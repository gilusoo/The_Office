Dwight:	That's what she said! [David laughs]
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

1.
Michael:	[obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Karen:	Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
Dwight:	I can't let you in, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

2.
Jim:	Alright.
Michael:	[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
Jo Bennett:	You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you.
Kevin:	Yeah, we can go eat pie.
Holly:	Well, some girls go through a phase.
Kevin:	I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Jim:	Okay.
Holly:	Oh I already bought this...
Jim:	[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]

3.
Andy:	Hey, boss.
Pam:	Jan's on the phone for you.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Darryl:	Yeah, Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jan:	Bye Babe!
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Creed:	[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Jim:	Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

4.
Pam:	No, it's, that's respectable.
Ed:	No.  They'll always think of you as a boss first.
Michael:	Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Pam:	You're in the gay mafia.
Pam:	Win
Creed:	Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Phyllis:	I guess so...
Pam:	A little different. What time is it there?

5.
Michael:	Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Michael:	Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jan:	I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Darryl:	Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Michael:	Italians don't wear pockets.
Phyllis:	Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	So weird.
Michael:	That's how devoted I am to this job.
Michael:	[knock on door] Yeah.
Michael:	Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...

6.
Julie:	So you work with Pam and Jim?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
Steve:	Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	You'll be fine over there.
Michael:	Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'

7.
Dwight:	No.
Pam:	Yeah, he came and went.
Pam:	I liked them.
Jim:	Ooh!
Meredith:	It's stupid.
Everyone:	Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless!
Jim:	I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Hey! What's up?

8.
Dwight:	Just trying to be helpful.
Michael:	Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Stanley:	Pass.
Ryan:	How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	I got a splinter.
Michael:	Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
Captain Jack:	Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
Gil:	Who's this?
Jim:	Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?

9.
Dwight:	Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Phyllis:	You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Michael:	Mm-hmm.
Pam:	Okay.
Michael:	Thank you.
Michael:	Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
Deangelo:	Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Everyone:	OH!
Michael:	That's not a baby.
Michael:	Get out.

10.
Dwight:	My cousin Mose told me a joke.
Mose:	But you promised.
Dwight:	It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Dwight:	Kill or be killed.
Holly:	Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

11.
Pam:	Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
Dwight:	Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Oscar:	Not occasionally. All the time.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Michael:	I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'
Jim:	You want to just make a run for it?
Pam:	Hey.

12.
Jan:	We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

13.
Pam:	Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Dwight:	Who are you talking to?
Pam:	I'm serious, take it down or else.
Todd:	Uh, it doesn���t include headshots.
Dwight:	God... Damn it! Why us?
Jim:	For a lot of reasons.
Michael:	Alright. Bye.
Michael:	Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?

14.
Jim:	Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Stanley:	You said bring a toothbrush.
Michael:	She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Andy:	Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
Jim:	Yes.
Michael:	You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
Michael:	Okay.
Dwight:	[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
Dwight:	Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Jim:	No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...

15.
Angela:	We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Erin:	I'm sorry.
Pam:	That sounds nice.
Michael:	I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Angela:	Hi.
Dwight:	Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
Pam:	Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Michael:	No, no.
Michael:	Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!

16.
Pam:	It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Pam:	No, that was a long time ago.
Pam:	I don't think anyone thought that.

17.
Angela:	What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
Dwight:	I figured it would save time.
Michael:	No. God. You go talk to him.
Carol:	[on phone] Hello, Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	No, you will not.
Michael:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.

18.
Isabel:	K.  [they kiss]
Michael:	No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
Charles:	Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Jim:	Hey, you have a second?
Michael:	Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Jim:	Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.

19.
Andy:	You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	Let's do it, shoot it.
Michael:	It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Dwight:	How much longer is this going to take?
Andy:	Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...
Jim:	Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Jim:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Let's go to the conference room.
Michael:	What was that, Kevin?

20.
Oscar:	[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Jan:	Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

21.
Kevin:	No.
Michael:	No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	That's so spicy.
Michael:	Good. Great.
Ben Franklin:	Thank you.
Jim:	Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

22.
Ryan:	This is from the sun.
Diane:	Wait, excuse me?
Ad guy 1:	Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
Jim:	[shaking head at the camera]

23.
Pam:	Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Andy:	What's that, Stanley?
Stanley:	Well...
Jan:	Well, you should.
Pam:	I think you should get dressed.
Jan:	And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Pam:	Mmm-hmm.
Stanley:	Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
Pam:	Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...

24.
Angela:	I don't understand what you want from me.
Michael:	And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Jim:	Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Andy:	Whoa!  What's the situation?

25.
Erin:	When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Jim:	Really?
Darryl:	No. I was clearing my throat.
Toby:	[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

26.
Darryl:	Yes.
Jim:	Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
Angela:	No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Pam:	Oh, hey, Isabelle.
Isabel:	Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Um, hi. How are you?
Jim:	Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Pam:	He said what?
Jim:	He's a jerk.
Pam:	Oh my god!
Jim:	Yeah.

27.
Kevin:	Nice. Nice.
Phyllis:	[to Kelly] Who's that?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Andy:	Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.

28.
Michael:	You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Erin:	[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Good night Vikram.

29.
Michael:	Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Oscar:	The numbers are correct, Michael.

30.
Michael:	Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Michael:	Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Jim:	You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Angela:	Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
Ryan:	Hey.
Angela:	Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Men:	[generalized clapping]
Michael:	Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

31.
Oscar:	Not at all.
Phyllis:	Made love? I don't know.
Ryan:	I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Kevin:	Or carnivals!
Dwight:	[tests smoke detector] Good.
Kevin:	Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Dwight:	Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Dwight:	Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
Bill:	Nice to meet you.
Jim:	Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.

32.
Jim:	He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
Jim:	Loggins and Messina.
Kevin:	After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
Isabel:	Hmm-hmm.
Mr. Brown:	Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	There is no such things as monsters.
Jim:	Kelly, you know what...

33.
Dwight:	Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	[sighs]
Jim:	Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
Mose:	I'm not supposed to say.

34.
Erin:	Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
Dwight:	Impossible, I love the law.
Ryan:	Yeah, totally.
Roy:	You look nice.
Dwight:	Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
Jim:	I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Ryan:	Literally.
Jim:	Robert.

35.
Kevin:	Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Phyllis:	She does have very nice clothes.
Darryl:	So you still missing Ryan?
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	Oops. [hangs up]

36.
Andy:	It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
Pam:	I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Oh. Hmm.
Erin:	As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Dwight:	I���ll get my apprehension kit.
Pam:	Excellent, thanks.
Pam:	I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Um...
Dwight:	She should thank me.

37.
Phyllis:	But I didn't report your snoring-
Michael:	Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
Michael:	No, no, no... no, no...
Meredith:	Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
Andy:	Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?
Phyllis:	Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!
Michael:	Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.

38.
Karen:	Listen, I-
Pam:	You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
Stanley:	No, I'm done.
Jim:	When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

39.
Jo:	Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
Phyllis:	No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Darryl:	A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?

40.
Dwight:	Did you get anything good?
Pam:	Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
M ichael:	Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Dwight:	Oh... no... really?

41.
Clark:	Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
Dwight:	[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
Jim:	Really? Does he do good work or--
Dwight:	Ahh!

42.
Michael:	What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Jim:	No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Andy:	I heard it from Erin.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Mr. Ramish:	What���s going on?
Jim:	Ok, great.
Michael:	Per mile, yes.
Jim:	We can go.
Andy:	Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	No, no, no!

43.
Michael:	You're 54 years old.
Nellie:	Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Everyone:	OH!
Dwight:	Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Dwight:	Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Jan:	I didn't...
Michael:	I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
Michael:	Hey Jim-bag.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Michael:	Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

44.
Dwight:	P.S. We should should kill him.
Toby:	Yeah. No, it's uncanny.
Michael:	Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Jim:	Hey.
Man:	Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
Toby:	I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

45.
Val:	That's what I'm sayin'.
Pam:	Can you believe that...
Gabe:	Ok let me go get it.
Oscar:	[opens door] Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Second.

46.
Dwight:	Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Someone:	So your trip to Scottsdale was good?
Prince Granddaughter:	Its all better.
Dwight:	You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Dwight:	You can't possibly be serious.
Kelly:	Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Pam:	Of course.
Pam:	Giant check it is.
Dwight:	No.  I think you should date Kelly.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
Dwight:	Impossible, I love the law.

47.
Michael:	Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
Michael:	Ahhh! Excellent.
Val:	Are you asking me on a date?
Dwight:	OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
Dwight:	What?

48.
Michael:	Um... Me no get an agenda.
Oscar:	He'll call.
Dwight:	Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?

49.
Kevin:	At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Dwight:	You are?
Gabe:	That is correct.
Kevin:	You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!

50.
Michael:	I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Stanley:	Well...
Andy:	Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
Pam:	Why was he making her laugh so much?
Kevin:	Okay.
Michael:	We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Andy:	Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Michael:	Exactly, were not...
Pam:	I can't do this.
Andy:	Great! [sits down]

51.
Dwight:	Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
Photographer:	Sir, could you look into the camera?
Michael:	Yes, about that.
Dwight:	Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.

52.
Jim:	No, no, no.
Dwight:	Oh, yeah.
Michael:	I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'
Michael:	Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Oscar:	It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
Bruce:	Made it.
Michael:	All right.

53.
Michael:	This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
Ryan:	Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Man in Video:	In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Michael:	[in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	Hello, traitor.
Hank:	Got a call about a problem up here.
Michael:	Live and let live.
Michael:	OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Ryan:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

54.
Stanley:	[throwing ball back] Nope.
Nellie:	oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Angela:	No.
Toby:	[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
Michael:	Hey!
Michael:	Nah, he's an ass.
Angela:	[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

55.
Dwight:	No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
David Wallace:	Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Pizza guy:	No.
Dwight:	You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Dwight:	Either he goes, or I go.
Jim:	So, don't tell.

56.
Jim:	Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	No.
Michael:	Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
Toby:	I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
Michael:	The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Michael:	Pamela Beesly Halpert--
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]

57.
Frank:	You son of a bitch!
Pam:	No one said it has no calories.
Michael:	No it's not.
Michael:	Okay, I have more of them.
Carroll:	What? Did you have that while we were together?
Meredith:	What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Michael:	Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	[to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

58.
Jim:	Dwight, how's the hotel business?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Student 2:	New question.
Michael:	Are you going to kill me?
Angela:	Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
Jim:	[picks up phone] Hello?
Dwight:	Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Michael:	I will allow that.
Michael:	Okay.  It's going to be great.

59.
Kevin:	What the hell?
Dwight:	You just said it. You just said it.
Pam:	Oh very.
Dwight:	I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Meredith:	Yeah, you gotta know.

60.
Michael:	Would you stop it, please?
Dwight:	Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Angela:	Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
Michael:	I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Dwight:	It's in the name.

61.
Jim:	Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Karen:	[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Stanley:	Stanley Hudson.
Phyllis:	Michael, that's awful.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Really?
Michael:	You know what? That's my foot.
Jim:	Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	What if she makes me?
Jim:	Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.

62.
Erin:	I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
Pete:	That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Meredith:	Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Meredith:	Shut up. Jakey?
Jake:	Do you have any computer games?
Jim:	That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Stanley:	Well...
Kevin:	[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

63.
Erin:	I don't want anyone to die.
Jim:	You alright, Santa?
Kevin:	But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Bob:	Yes!

64.
Roy:	No, you take it easy.
Michael:	Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Stanley:	Well...
Phyllis:	How far along is Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Michael:	Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
Pam:	That is so insulting.
Michael:	No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
Michael:	Okay. [passes Jim some index cards]

65.
Michael:	Sure it is.
Michael:	Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
Pam:	That could really be fun.
Michael:	I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Brandon:	Hope you all like goat.
Andy:	Oscar
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

66.
Andy:	Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Jim:	So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Michael:	Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Michael:	What?
Andy:	She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.

67.
Dwight:	Part of my job.
Pam:	You can do this.
Meredith:	I think it looks good.
Jim:	Okay.
Pam:	Can I turn on the radio?
Michael:	Well, that...
Michael:	All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

68.
Creed:	You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Andy:	What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
Justin:	Sorry for wasting your time.
Dwight:	Master bee.
Master:	[Dwight grunts] Great. Excellent. [Dwight yells] All right. That's okay.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Andy:	Absolutely.
Andy:	Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Andy:	I'm her fiance.

69.
Pam:	What's up?
Kevin:	Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Holly:	You must be Todd.
Todd:	Hey, did you get that package I left for you?
Michael:	Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Jim:	I...  Pam, please.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

70.
Walter:	I'm eating, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jan:	OK.
David:	Hmm.
Charles:	Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
Andy:	It's over.

71.
Michael:	I don't know about that.
Michael:	In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Meredith:	Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jan:	Oh, yes, you will.
Michael:	Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.

72.
Rose:	Yeah, okay.  You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
Robert:	He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Jan:	I didn't go.
Creed:	I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Michael:	Forget that.
Michael:	Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	It's okay. It's all right.
Michael:	Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-

73.
Michael:	She has a boyfriend.
Angela:	You
Kevin:	Bye, Phillip. High five.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Darryl:	Block, block, block!
Michael:	Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	Mmm.

74.
Pam:	Yeah, he came and went.
Phyllis:	I think I just got flashed.
Ryan:	David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

75.
Jim:	Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Michael:	[on the phone] Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.
Dwight:	What about you?
Oscar:	Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Toby:	He has a doctor's note.
Dwight:	Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
Michael:	Let's see...
Jim:	No, that's not what I-
Michael:	It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Michael:	[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Jim:	Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.

76.
Jim:	Ok.
Dwight:	Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Dwight:	Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Andy:	Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	Okay. Fine.
Jan:	Conniving little runt. Put him through.
Jim:	I closed it!

77.
Danny:	Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Man 2:	Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Ryan:	What's the dress code on this?
Angela:	Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Whoo.
Michael:	That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.

78.
Dwight:	Store only has three employees.
Erin:	[at vending machine] B-9.
Karen:	I'm-
Pete:	Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
Michael:	[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Dwight:	Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Michael:	[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.

79.
Dwight:	Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
DeAngelo:	Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Meredith:	Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
Darryl:	And?
Andy:	Did he tell you how I got the name?
Dwight:	You���re really going to want the booster.
Andy:	Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
Dwight:	Yes.

80.
Jim:	Okay.
Michael:	What do you like Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Phyllis:	It's going well.
Pete:	I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
Michael:	No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.

81.
Dwight:	She had a hysterectomy.
Dwight:	You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Pam:	Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

82.
Jim:	[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	Thank you, Holly.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Meredith:	Because it's on my genitals, genius.
Holly:	Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Jim:	Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Jim:	Hey.
Michael:	BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Jim:	[growling] Nice.

83.
Phyllis:	You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Michael:	Like... I don't... I don't know.
Pam:	Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Dwight:	I got a knock-knock joke.
Dwight:	Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
Dwight:	And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.

84.
Robert:	No, no. I'm very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.
Oscar:	Where was that.
Michael:	[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.
Darryl:	What kind of job?
Angela:	He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
Michael:	That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Ed:	Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Michael:	I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Michael:	Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
Michael:	I have a laundry machine!
Michael:	Me? Okay.

85.
Pam:	Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Phil:	I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?
Jim:	Which we are.
Ryan:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Jim:	Alright.
Pam:	Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Jim:	Talk to me.
Pam:	What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?

86.
Clark:	Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Photographer:	[shoots twice]
Dwight:	I'm thirsty.
Michael:	Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Jim:	Hmm?
Michael:	My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]

87.
Phyllis:	What are these for?
Dwight:	Please.
Dwight:	When no one hedded--
Pam:	Hey, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

88.
Nellie:	So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Robert:	Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
Jim:	What are you talking about?
Michael:	Ah, fine.
Jim:	Not bad.
Michael:	Ha.

89.
Jim:	Ok.
Dwight:	[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Jessica:	I dunno.
Michael:	I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
Pam:	Of course you will.
Dwight:	Accept it, why would he come back?
Michael:	[on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?

90.
Andy:	Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Sasha:	[shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!!
Jim:	Yeah.
Dwight:	[Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
Dwight:	Ed was decapitated.
Ed:	Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Jim:	Seriously?
Andy:	Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Andy:	What's up, gangstas?
Dwight:	Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.

91.
Andy:	I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	Ahh!
Andy:	Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
Andy:	I am gay, and I prefer men.
Michael:	I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Helene:	[walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

92.
All:	Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
Andy:	Sorry?
Jan:	No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Pam:	Um, what?
Michael:	We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
Michael:	Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
Michael:	That would never happen.
Andy:	Hi gam-gam.
Pam:	Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Isabel:	Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Yes

93.
Pam:	Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
Jan:	[laughing]
Michael:	Count the last one.
Michael:	Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Creed:	Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Devon:	Creed's an idiot, you know that.
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Michael:	[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
Pam:	Hey, Hon, are you close?
Pam:	That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]

94.
Dwight:	Cocks in the henhouse.
Karen:	...to knit.
Pam:	No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
Andy:	Hang on.
Dwight:	That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
Michael:	All right. Good night.

95.
Kevin:	Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	Okay.
Toby:	...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
Jim:	Yeah.
Alex:	Why did you come to New York in the first place?
Kevin:	I suck.
Jim:	Yeah

96.
Michael:	Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Andy:	The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Kevin:	That was a really cool move.
Karen:	[laughing] Yeah.
Andy:	Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
Michael:	Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
Oscar:	Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

97.
Dwight:	[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Danny:	I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Karen:	Really?

98.
Jim:	Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Darryl:	Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Roy:	Hey, man.
Kevin:	Bye.
Michael:	No. No. No.
Jim:	Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Jim:	Let's give it a shot.
Jim:	Right... That's good.

99.
Phyllis:	Okay.
Michael:	You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Darryl:	I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Holly:	I can't wait.
Michael:	I know...
Darryl:	You want me to invite Matt?
Matt:	I don't think so.

100.
Michael:	No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.
Darryl:	Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Matt:	I don't think so.
Michael:	I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
Toby:	Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

101.
Josh:	Yes.
Dwight:	No.
Holly:	Yeah.
Oscar:	[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
Pam:	Hm-hmm.
Dwight:	Shh, shh, shh.
Pam:	Oh my god! It's really you!
Dwight:	Thank you.

102.
Dwight:	So tape it down.
Michael:	You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
Dwight:	[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Pam:	Three. [Daryl nods]
Daryl:	Hey.
Michael:	Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
Erin:	I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Dwight:	Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Pam:	Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.

103.
Michael:	Awesome.
Phyllis:	Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Jim:	Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.

104.
Gabe:	Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	Oh.
Jim:	Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
Michael:	Hi, Oscar its Michael.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

105.
Andy:	Which is insanely painful.
Michael:	Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
Lefevre:	Hey, Mr. Scott.
Fourth Shareholder:	How are you gonna fix the company?
Andy:	Thank you.
Michael:	Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?

106.
Dwight:	[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Stanley:	[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	[chuckles, sighs]

107.
Dwight:	I know. You���re gonna be okay, Monkey.
Dwight:	[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
Gabe:	Your wish is my command.
Kelly:	Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Nice.
Michael:	Oh.
Michael:	[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.

108.
Oscar:	I'll get him water.
Jim:	Agoraphobic?
Oscar:	Thank you.
Kevin:	Yes!
Pam:	[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.

109.
Pam:	I'm good.
Jim:	[unbelievingly] Okay...
Michael:	Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Angela:	I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Jim:	She's not your grandmother, is she?
Michael:	Let's do this.
Meredith:	Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Michael:	No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.
Jim:	Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.

110.
Michael:	Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
Toby:	Did you even read it?
Michael:	I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.
Angela:	Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.

111.
Sasha:	One, two, three!
Dwight:	You don't keep a diary.
Molly:	Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant.  And I guess it did get a little confusing  ���cause you said not to tell anyone your name.  And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...
Tom:	Hey, future baby sis!
Dwight:	A little eye for an eye action.
Dwight:	Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
Angela:	I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Dwight:	Yes. Of course.
Dwight:	Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Dwight:	[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

112.
Pam:	[giggles at Roy]
Roy:	Hey, man.
Creed:	Oh nothing.
Darryl:	This was your freshman year.
Pam:	Okay.
Nate:	I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Pam:	Um...
Creed:	I don't know, let's try.
Pam:	Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

113.
Waitress:	That's fine.
Pam:	This.
Dwight:	AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Andy:	And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Yeah.
Pam:	No, right, no, no.
Michael:	I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
Pam:	[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
Ryan:	Hey.
Andy:	Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]

114.
Jim:	And that's what I told him.
Gabe:	- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	No this is Holly.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?

115.
Oscar:	This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
Toby:	Uh... it... compliment...
Dwight:	The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
Kevin:	Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
Michael:	I am telling Andy.

116.
Michael:	No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack:	Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
Gil:	Who's this?
Andy:	What���re you still doing here?
Michael:	Are you calling Karen?
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Talla-nasty', very clever.
Andy:	Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
Michael:	Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
Andy:	Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
Jim:	Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.

117.
Michael:	Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Phyllis:	Oh! Mother ******!
Mother:	[on speakerphone] Hello?
speaker:	line_text
A.J.:	It's pretty serious, yes.
Michael:	Who should it come from, then?
Michael:	Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
Michael:	[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.
Michael:	Oh! Oh! Oh!

118.
Jim:	He's fine. He's indestructible.
Kevin:	[with mouth full] Yes.
Dwight:	Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Nate:	No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Kevin:	No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!

119.
Jan:	I know Scranton.
Dwight:	I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Jim:	Yeah, you don't?
Michael:	Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	I take full responsibility.
Jim:	Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Michael:	You get me.

120.
Andy:	I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Walter:	So, you all work with Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Cece:	[crying]
Dwight:	Oh, no. What's wrong?
Dwight:	Wait, what girlfriend?

121.
Jim:	At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.

122.
Oscar:	At least he is in the building.
Daryl:	Absolutely.
Jim:	Which is you.
Jim:	I don't... I don't think so.
Michael:	This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.

123.
Jim:	Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Cece:	[crying]
Pam:	Don't you think you should say something?
Michael:	Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Michael:	Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Pam:	No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Pam:	Ok.
Jim:	Hey Kelly. What's up?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Pam:	Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.

124.
David Wallace:	I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	We are a law firm.
Michael:	I'll see you later.
Michael:	Nah, he's an ass.
Andy:	Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Pam:	I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Michael:	I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.

125.
Mose:	Guten Prank.
Pam:	But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
Michael:	You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
Pam:	Still no one calling.
Kevin:	About what?

126.
Erin:	Hey.
Son:	We don't know what he does with them.
Carroll:	You didn't call my office and ask where I was?
Andy:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
Erin:	Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Andy:	I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Erin:	You���re not married yet?
Andy:	Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.

127.
Kevin:	So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Dwight:	No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Jim:	Who doesn't love that?
Kevin:	That's hilarious.
Kelly:	I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Ryan:	Hey.
Dwight:	[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Zeke:	Dwight���s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower.
Mose:	But you promised.
Jim:	Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Dwight:	I can see that happening.

128.
Jim:	[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Andy:	Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
Oscar:	It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Andy:	Yeah���um, how is everything?
Holly:	...Hell yeah.
Jim:	You know, try sending them another invoice.

129.
Andy:	For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Andy:	You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Oh! God. Dwight, come on...

130.
Nellie:	Well then if I could just convince...
Dwight:	Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
Dwight:	Argh!
Pam:	Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Darryl:	You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Brad:	Okay, well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Dwight:	Do you love me or not?
Dwight:	[Jo leaves] I, uh...
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

131.
Jim:	Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	Hi.
Michael:	All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	I'm rejecting your...
Pam:	Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Michael:	I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.

132.
Ryan:	You too.
Jim:	Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Kevin:	Oooh.
Ryan:	Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Darryl:	I'm good.
Jim:	You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Jim:	[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.

133.
Charles:	So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Kelly:	Just leave me alone!
Tom:	Hey.
Michael:	What?
Michael:	Wouldn't that be fun?
Michael:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
Michael:	One for me one for Jan.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Yeah.

134.
Michael:	So it's a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It's not anything you would have ever done.
Oscar:	We'll miss you.
Creed:	Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Kevin:	Open QuickTime.
Michael:	It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Michael:	Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.

135.
Andy:	Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Police Officer 2:	Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
Dwight:	We measured it once...
Blonde:	Look, we already have a paper supplier.
Dwight:	The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.

136.
Pam:	Personal shopper?
Group chant:	Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Pam:	Your brothers took you out drinking?
Michael:	I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
Michael:	Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
Michael:	---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Jim:	No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Michael:	Ah, what? Which memo?
Pam:	Good.

137.
Pam:	Right.
Jim:	I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Jim:	That I thought we were millionaires.
Isabelle:	Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
Jim:	Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?

138.
Michael:	Yeah-es.
Dwight:	Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

139.
Dwight:	How much do you have?
Phyllis:	It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Jim:	Ok.
Michael:	Just give it!
Michael:	Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Jim:	Michael. Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.

140.
Michael:	Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Jim:	Maybe poison?
Andy:	Well it's the thought that counts.
Dwight:	No, please don't do this, monkey.
Pam:	He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?

141.
Michael:	I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.
Ryan:	Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Stanley:	[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
Toby:	Yeah, could we...
Michael:	And they had no yams?
Michael:	You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
Michael:	Newspapers for sale!
Michael:	No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.

142.
Jim:	Who doesn't love that?
Andy:	Ah, OK.
Meredith:	It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Ryan:	Cool.
Jim:	So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?

143.
Michael:	[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
Jim:	Because my car broke down.
Angela:	Honey, say something!
Andy:	Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Andy:	What do I put you down for, bro hombre?

144.
Michael:	Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
Men:	[generalized clapping]
Dwight:	...Okay.
Phyllis:	That's not a good idea, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	[laughs]
Michael:	And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Jim:	No, you chose yourself.
Dwight:	Did you do her?
Michael:	Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.

145.
Holly:	Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Charles:	Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Dwight:	And you'll compare the times?
Pam:	Aww.
Michael:	I'll work on that-
Pam:	I really hope you get the job.
Michael:	Yes! Yes! All right. We got game!
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?

146.
Kevin:	The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Stanley:	I'm outta here.
Erin:	I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Erin:	No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Erin:	Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Roy:	So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Pam:	[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Fine.
Pam:	Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?

147.
Phyllis:	Her hair looks beautiful.
Michael:	Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
Michael:	Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Cece:	Bye, Daddy.
Jim:	I'm couching it!
Jim:	[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	What do you know about boobs?
Michael:	Thank you.

148.
Michael:	Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Dwight:	[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

149.
Kevin:	I think he's singing.
Dwight:	So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Michael:	Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Michael:	Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
The Kids:	[raising hands] I do, I do!
Michael:	Erin, can you give us a second?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Dwight:	Where?

150.
Kevin:	So, there was talk of oatmeal.
DeAngelo:	Meee Mo, Mee!
Jim:	A...hot chocolate tea
David Wallace:	Why do you already have this?
Michael:	Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.

151.
Rafe:	Iceman.
Nellie:	$30, yes!
Meredith:	Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	Just transfer the damn call.
Jim:	Right, the one from England.
Jim:	That's not the point.
Meredith:	Three hundred and five.
Jim:	Nope.
Nellie:	Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
Jim:	Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Jim:	Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?

152.
David:	...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Phyllis:	Dwight...
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

153.
Kelly:	Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Stanley:	Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Jan:	Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
Dwight:	Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.

154.
Jim:	What?
Michael:	That's really nice of you to say.
Michael:	Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
Angela:	Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Senator:	You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	...it happens once every billion years.
Michael:	You're 54 years old.
Michael:	Jim, please no loopholes.

155.
Zion:	I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother.
Mikela:	Mr. Scott?
Improv Teacher:	No, it wasn't.  No more guns.
Dwight:	Wait, shut up.
Jim:	Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Yeah.
Jim:	Yeah!

156.
Pam:	Haha!  Ha ha ha.
Andy:	Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Robert:	I just did.

157.
Jan:	Please? Thank you. very much.
Darryl:	This is what you want?
Holly:	It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	I think it's going to be any minute now.
Darryl:	I know, I know. It's just hard.

158.
Guy:	We're actually building them a school.
Michael:	Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Angela:	Yes, What are you doing here?
Michael:	No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Michael:	[laughs, looks to camera excitedly]
Ryan:	No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?

159.
David:	They did?
Jim:	Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Michael:	Good.
Jim:	Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Andy:	Think we'll find him?
Pam:	Okay, stop.
Jim:	So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Michael:	Except driving.
Andy:	Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Deangelo:	I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.

160.
Creed:	I can get you one in an hour.
Jim:	Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
Michael:	Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?

161.
Nurse:	Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'
Michael:	I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Andy:	My new girlfriend.
Michael:	I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
Andy:	If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

162.
Pam:	Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
Gabe:	Right, of course!
Creed:	Have fun!  [sigh]
Oscar:	If you don't mind me asking---
Andy:	Close it.
Andy:	I didn't know you were going to be here.
Oscar:	We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.

163.
Andy:	Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Michael:	In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Oscar:	Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Michael:	Yes I do.
Michael:	[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
Michael:	[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.

164.
David:	We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Michael:	Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Michael:	Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Michael:	I don't like that story babe.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?

165.
Nellie:	Whoo!
David Wallace:	So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Dwight:	Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Pam:	Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Kevin:	For sure. [murmurs from group in agreement]
Nellie:	I���m sexy Toby.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Kevin:	No.
Kevin:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.

166.
Dwight:	It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Dwight:	What?
Kevin:	Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Its��� I mean come on.
Andy:	[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

167.
Jan:	No.
Michael:	No. Oh, all right.
Ryan:	That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
Michael:	What, are you talking about me and Holly?
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Michael:	[on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
Meredith:	Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
Michael:	What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Michael:	Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

168.
Andy:	I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Pam:	[tires screeching] Oh.
Robert:	Yes, hello, nice to meet you.
Michael:	Too expensive.
Michael:	That's what makes it so wrong.

169.
Jim:	You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Michael:	Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
Oscar:	With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Michael:	Let's go in here.
Michael:	A DSi?
Oscar:	Oh...
Michael:	Would she get into trouble?
Darryl:	Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

170.
Dwight:	Yeah!
Michael:	Hi. How are you?
Kevin:	Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Michael:	Oh really.
Michael:	Dwight, do you mind if we talk?

171.
Toby:	Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
Pam:	I'm cold.
Andy:	[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Michael:	Good work. [clapping]
Toby:	If they were dilated...
Pam:	I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Michael:	Got it. It works.
Toby:	Uh huh.
Michael:	No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.

172.
People in line:	Oh come on! Hey!
Jim:	Wait, what? Come on!
Nellie:	Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Oscar:	Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Oscar:	More or less.
Pam:	I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Pam:	I'll make the call.

173.
Michael:	Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Michael:	Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Erin:	Yeah.
Jim:	Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Stanley:	You want the lead?
Creed:	I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Jim:	[makes kissing, puckering sound]
Erin:	Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Michael:	Umm, hmmm.

174.
Dwight:	[agreeing] Mm.
Angela:	How many gods do you have?
Jim:	Private Room.
Dwight:	Eight minutes!
Pam:	Wait. What?
Michael:	She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
Michael:	You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

175.
Jim:	Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Michael:	Ok.
Michael:	Wow, man. That -
Dwight:	That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Robert:	Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.

176.
Erin:	Retail consumer habits.
Clark:	Oooohhhhhhhh!
Pam:	When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Dwight:	It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Dwight:	Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Andy:	Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
Lady:	Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
Dwight:	I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
Pam:	I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.

177.
Dwight:	Yeah.
Michael:	Really?
Kelly:	Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Michael:	Yes, your corner. Go.
Jim:	Wow.
Michael:	I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	Why?
Jim:	Go get 'em.

178.
Walter:	Andrew...
Dwight:	Hey.
Andy:	I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
Dwight:	Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Kelly:	You did? I wanna see the cake.
Michael:	After breakfast.

179.
Michael:	So, okay.
Andy:	But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
Jim:	Wow, what are we talking about?
Erin:	Oh! Darryl's funny.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Andy:	No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.

180.
Meredith:	Sure!  That sounds fun!
Alice:	Hi.
Toby:	Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Michael:	Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
Angela:	It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Michael:	French. Classy.
Angela:	Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	You look great.
Jim:	No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.

181.
Meredith:	Hey, where is the steak sauce?
Andy:	Oh. Hmm.
Jim:	I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Michael:	Mmhmm!
Jim:	That is a lie, that is a lie.
Mose:	Welcome children.
Jim:	Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Jim:	Ding Dong.

182.
Pam:	Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]
Stanley:	Well...

183.
Andy:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Kelly:	I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Ryan:	Hey.
Andy:	Dwight?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Ryan:	Yeah.

184.
Karen:	Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
Oscar:	Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Dwight:	No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.

185.
Michael:	All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
Dwight:	I can handle that.
Holly:	Look at where my seats were.
Toby:	[takes duck back] Yes.
Michael:	Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	This is great.
Jim:	Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

186.
Andy:	Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
Jim:	You mean Kevin?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Pam:	Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
Pam:	I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Kevin:	[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Pam:	That's it.
Pam:	No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.

187.
Melissa:	So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
Pam:	Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Pam:	Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
David:	It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
Angela:	Ugh.
Michael:	Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.

188.
Michael:	[singing] ...since the world was turning.
Mr. Brown:	Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Pam:	I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.

189.
Michael:	Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Pam:	She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
Kevin:	You wanna play with the cactus?
Roy:	You can't keep anything from me.
Everyone:	[separately] Awww.
Pam:	OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Pam:	OK.

190.
Dwight:	Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Ryan:	No you weren't.
Stanley:	Get us out of this!
Jim:	Look, you have a lot of strengths.

191.
Dwight:	Yes?
Pam:	Come on, it won't be that bad.
Michael:	[phone rings] Yeah?
Jim:	Uh... Not a bad day.
Michael:	It didn't come up organically.
Michael:	Oh thank God.
Andy:	Gosh, I hope so.

192.
Ryan:	Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Dwight:	You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Michael:	Morning, Pam.  Hey.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Deposition Reporter:	Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Pam:	Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

193.
Dwight:	What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Jim:	What was that?
Dwight:	[scoffs]
Michael:	Yes.
Oscar:	You call him!
Clark:	If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
Dwight:	And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
Jim:	No? Nothin'?
Michael:	No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Dwight:	My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.

194.
Michael:	Gin. [toast, sip]
Dwight:	Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Michael:	I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.
Mose:	Name's Mose, buddy!  Dwight, can I stop?  They're not even looking.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	500
David:	Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Pam:	Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Michael:	Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
Michael:	Booty call.
Michael:	Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

195.
Dwight:	Damn it!
Kevin:	Here you go. [hands money]
Phyllis:	Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

196.
Pam:	[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Not important.
Kevin:	And that is Dallas. [shows money]

197.
Michael:	Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
Jim:	Done, right?
Pam:	I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Bob:	Yes!
Michel:	Um, yeah.
Michael:	Yes.
Michael:	Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	What?
Jim:	That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?

198.
Photographer:	I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Stanley:	I admire your culture's success in America.
Creed:	I miss Clinton.
Michael:	Look at his face! Look at his face!
Michael:	Wonder what I would've been back home?
Oscar:	I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Michael:	...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Creed:	[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

199.
Oscar:	I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Michael:	Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Ryan:	Hey.
Toby:	Christmas.
Angela:	Her name was Sprinkles.
Oscar:	Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Michael:	That would be sublime.
Ryan:	You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Angela:	Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Michael:	Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!

200.
Jim:	Ok, ok, ok.
Pam:	It's just office pranks.
Michael:	Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?
Pam:	No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
Andy:	I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Michael:	Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
Jim:	Right? I was just thinking...
Brian:	Let me grab a couple drinks.
Andy:	[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
Jim:	Cool.

201.
Dwight:	Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Ex-client:	It looks delicious? I don't know.
Toby:	Come on.
Angela:	It's fabric! I really wanted this.
Darryl:	[to camera] There it is.
Darryl:	It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Dwight:	Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Which is you' is not a sentence.
Dwight:	[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
Jim:	No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Dwight:	No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]

202.
Michael:	Thank you!  Wish me luck!
Michael:	Cool, cool. Box it up.
Stanley:	Zero.
Michael:	Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Eric:	Right.
Michael:	No, no, no... no, no...
Angela:	The senator will be joining us later.
Oscar:	You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Michael:	Eat it!

203.
Michael:	I gave it to you in the car.
Toby:	Yes.
Michael:	Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Yeah.
Michael:	[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Jim:	I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Michael:	It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!'
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.

204.
Pam:	How about Darryl?
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
David:	Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Frank:	You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there. [gestures mural]
Jim:	Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Pam:	Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

205.
Dwight:	I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Michael:	Why?  Wha...
Jim:	I will do some research.
IT Tech Guy:	Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
Jan:	[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Hunter:	Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.

206.
Michael:	It's a heart.
Andy:	What did you say?
Dwight:	Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

207.
Oscar:	What's that supposed to mean?
Jim:	Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Great.

208.
Jim:	Yes.
Oscar:	Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
Michael:	Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
Andy:	Yeah!
Jim:	Nice.
Jim:	So, none of that tipped you off?
Jim:	Right. It's city and country combined.
Pam:	Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Andy:	What?
Pam:	How'd it go?

209.
Dwight:	What? It's a casual, social outfit.
Dwight:	Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
Michael:	Oh. He did? What did he say?
Angela:	No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Jim:	Nope.
Angela:	You don���t want me at your place.
Jim:	Who, Steve?
Steve:	Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	Maybe.

210.
Michael:	I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Donna:	Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.

211.
Dwight:	You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Darryl:	Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Meredith:	We can drink?
Pam:	Admit what?
Dwight:	Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Charles:	Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

212.
Andy:	Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
Andy:	I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Karen:	Oh, come on, guys. Please.
Oscar:	[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
Jake:	Do you have any computer games?
Pam:	Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Cece:	[crying]
Oscar:	And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Pam:	What?
Oscar:	Use it in a sentence.
Pam:	No. I'm such a dorky dancer.

213.
Alex:	Why did you come to New York in the first place?
Michael:	Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
Oscar:	You heard me correctly.
Erin:	Hello.

214.
Angela:	Yes.
Stanley:	Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
Kelly:	I'll text you!
Dwight:	It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

215.
Phyllis:	Again with the cousin.
Kevin:	So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Andy:	Later man.
Michael:	We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.

216.
Dwight:	I'll do a shot, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Got it.
Kevin:	Yeah Jim, why's it so far?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

217.
All:	[chanting] Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
Bruce:	Made it.
Pam:	Well, look closer.
Michael:	I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
Stanley:	Well...

218.
Jim:	Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Michael:	It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Charles:	Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	I'm sure he'll be fine.
Brian:	They want to know how much what?
Michael:	Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Michael:	Dwight! Jesus!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

219.
Jim:	You bet.
Phyllis:	Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Ryan:	Oh my god!
Dwight:	Her name?

220.
Dwight:	Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Ed:	Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Jim:	Wrong, for so many reasons.
Rolf:	Nice.
Pam:	Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]

221.
Kelly:	I'm dying!
Oscar:	Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Jim:	Um...
Jim:	When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

222.
Ryan:	I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Andy:	Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
All:	[murmuring as Dwight holds up toy forklift]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

223.
Dwight:	You're lying. We didn't win.
Angela:	I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
Holly:	Okay.
Jim:	Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Good to see you, too.
Dwight:	[smiling] No thank you.
Dwight:	You know where it is. Lead me there.
Pam:	Here. [hands drink]
Jim:	Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

224.
Pam:	[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	You failed?
Michael:	[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.
Dwight:	Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
Toby:	You can only fire Nellie for cause.
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Michael:	Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.
Michael:	Just...

225.
Phyllis:	You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
Pam:	I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Kelly:	Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Dwight:	Our theme, if you will.
Jim:	Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Pam:	Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Jim:	I tried. He will not listen.
Jim:	Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

226.
Michael:	We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
Michael:	No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
Michael:	David, wait.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
Michael:	Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

227.
Angela:	Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Michael:	Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Jim:	Yep.
Jim:	So, really, you're just calling her?

228.
Dwight:	So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
Phyllis:	...report you to HR.
Angela:	We get it.
Kevin:	Little old man boy.
Dwight:	Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Hank:	Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Michael:	I don't.

229.
Pam:	Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Dwight:	I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
Clark:	Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
Gabe:	[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Jim:	For a lot of reasons.
Pam:	Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'

230.
Michael:	Yeah!
Oscar:	Easy.
Michael:	No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Master:	You're gonna have to take them off. It's a sign of respect.
Michael:	Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline!
Jim:	[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Office:	Aw, Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

231.
Michael:	That's so spicy.
Dwight:	Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
Michael:	But the branch is still mine?
Dwight:	It is hard to imagine you playing softball.

232.
Jo:	Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	Okay, no.
Andy:	I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Jim:	Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Michael:	They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Michael:	Just... try to be cool.
Michael:	[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Andy:	Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
Employee:	I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.

233.
Jim:	Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Jim:	Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Jim:	[concerned look on face] You okay?
Phyllis:	Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Creed:	The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
Grotti:	Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
Michael:	We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
Michael:	Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.

234.
Dwight:	You did.
Pam:	OK.
Martin:	[sniffs. Pans to Creed eating his mungbeans.]
Creed:	Huh?
Dennis:	���And I want to reach every demographic possible.
Dwight:	Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Pam:	What?
Dwight:	Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Dwight:	[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Everyone:	OH!
Dwight:	I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]

235.
Jim:	It's going to be alright.
Meredith:	[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
Dwight:	Fine.
Dwight:	Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Jim:	Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Clark:	Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
Michael:	Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Stripper:	Hi, boys!
Michael:	[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
Michael:	Thanks, Steve.

236.
Andy:	I play the banjo.
Michael:	Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Pam:	Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael:	There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.

237.
Brad:	Sweet. [camera zooms in on Pam]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Angela:	I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?

238.
School Official:	The issue with the watermark is very serious.
Dwight:	Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Deangelo:	Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
Andy:	It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
Michel:	[walks into the office with a large, fake mustache on] Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Dwight:	[low] Oh God, here.
Dwight:	Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	Well ���
Andy:	I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.

239.
Jim:	Where'd you get that?
Angela:	What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
Michael:	Ouchy.
Michael:	[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

240.
Jan:	Can we please go in your office?
Jim:	Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Toby:	[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
Toby:	Just keep going.
Toby:	I have good cards.
Jim:	Umm...
Jim:	Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Jim:	[whispering] Would you please stop that?
Jim:	No, I....

241.
Pam:	You had to be there.
Dwight:	I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
Jim:	Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.
Michael:	Last gift. Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Michael:	I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
Jim:	You want to talk about it?
Dwight:	I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Jim:	I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Dwight:	Oh, I like it.

242.
Jim:	Smasher!
Michael:	[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.
Nellie:	Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
Michael:	Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
Stanley:	This is not natural.
Male Applicant 1:	I need a job.
Michael:	[off camera] That's terrible.
Michael:	You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Jim:	That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Michael:	[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!

243.
Michael:	Doubt it. [disconnects call]
Jim:	De class���.
Michael:	Which one is that again?
Michael:	Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

244.
Andy:	We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
Dwight:	[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
Henry:	Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
Dwight:	Oh my goodness.

245.
Michael:	Well, he...
Michael:	Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Angela:	Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	Why

246.
Jim:	You're good... you're good at sales.
Jim:	Split the difference?
Michael:	Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
Ben:	Hi Michael.

247.
Pam:	Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	Michael, just go park the car.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Let it go.

248.
Michael:	I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
Michael:	Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
Jan:	I���m a very busy woman, so...
Karen:	Uh, what are you doing here?
Esther:	Oh. Is she a gambler?
Kevin:	[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
Everybody:	Surprise!
Angela:	No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Michael:	Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.

249.
Pam:	OK, bye.
Dwight:	Ow.
Todd:	Check it out!
Pam:	What happened to grape soda?
Andy:	No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
Jim:	You shouldn't be talking about that.

250.
Billy Merchant:	I don't know, like 30 seconds?
Hank:	I don't think so.
Holly:	Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
Pam:	Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
Jim:	Is he you?

251.
Michael:	Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Phyllis:	Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Pam:	That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
Andy:	Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
Jim:	Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?

252.
Oscar:	[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Pam:	Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
Darryl's sister:	Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of pistols in holsters]
Andy:	Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
Dwight:	No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Andy:	Oh, God!
Andy:	Excuse me.

253.
Dwight:	Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Michael:	All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	Ooh, Toby!
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Dwight:	Please sir! Spare him. Please.
Michael:	You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Ryan:	Hey.
Dwight:	Been there, done that.
Dwight:	Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.

254.
Pam:	Dwight, am I hot right now?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Oscar:	State senator.
Angela:	I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Kevin, do you feel OK?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	It's in my purse.
Dwight:	Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.

255.
Michael:	We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Soldier:	I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they���ll feel like anything is possible.
Dwight:	Right?
Michael:	Ok.
Angela:	Sure.
Michael:	he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Jim:	Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.

256.
Michael:	No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Angela:	Call him! Call him!
Michael:	Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Michael:	Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
Angela:	[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?

257.
Meredith:	Oh, that's part of my dream too.
Michael:	Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
Andy:	Yeah, yeah.
Dwight:	Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Kelly:	Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?

258.
Michael:	I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
O'Keefe:	What was that about?
Andy:	Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
Kenny:	Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?
Kevin:	No, no.
Michael:	Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...

259.
Erin:	Seriously?
Businessman #1:	I killed it.
Andy:	[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Someone:	So your trip to Scottsdale was good?

260.
Michael:	[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Toby:	But there aren't...
Nellie:	No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
Meredith:	That scowl.
Michael:	I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Toby:	Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Andy:	Didn't see that coming.
Toby:	Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Amy:	Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?
Michael:	Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?

261.
Jim:	No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jan:	So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Andy:	Hey, have you guys seen her?
Jim:	Solitaire?
Michael:	We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?

262.
Michael:	And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Michael:	No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
Ryan:	Hey.
Creed:	Think they're talking about me?
Angela:	Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Michael:	Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Dwight:	Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.

263.
Dwight:	Ok, give that back to me.
Michael:	I'll work on that-
Dwight:	That's a common swindlers trick.
Michael:	Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

264.
Creed:	Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
Josh:	Um, we should...
Phyllis:	I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Pete:	Did she buy it?
Andy:	[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
Andy:	[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
Andy:	Yeah Jim, get it out there.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Second drink?
Andy:	Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.

265.
Jim:	Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Mr. Beesly:	I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	Who are you talking to?
Nellie:	No, you don't understand-
Dwight:	You came into my office voluntarily.

266.
Dwight:	Where?
Stanley:	I had Mexican food.
Jim:	Alright.
Michael:	It's seems like ya did though-
Stanley:	[chuckles]
Andy:	Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]

267.
Dwight:	Cause you're sweeter than candy.
Clark:	Come in.
Dwight:	So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Michael:	Smells good.
Michael:	Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
Meredith:	People in the other group.
Jim:	Eight months?
Jim:	Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Dwight:	There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Michael:	The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.

268.
Phyllis:	You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Rolf:	Thank you, Dwight. I���ll be in touch.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Dwight:	No.
Dwight:	[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]

269.
Dwight:	Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Someone:	So your trip to Scottsdale was good?
Michael:	Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.
Michael:	Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Dwight:	I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Michael:	Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.

270.
Andy:	Close it.
Phyllis:	I know
Michael:	Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Pam:	That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
Michael:	Well-
Phyllis:	Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.

271.
Michael:	Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
HCT Member #3:	I thought you were Adam Lambert.
Ryan:	Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Nellie:	Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

272.
Andy:	Hey, we'll be just fine.
Andy:	Yeah, if I had my own--
Jim:	Nothing.
Kelly:	(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
Pam:	[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Dwight:	Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.

273.
Dwight:	I would remember.
Jim:	I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Pam:	Oh.
Pam:	What? Why?
Jo:	Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
Michael:	Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
Michael:	This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
Michael:	Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.

274.
Andy:	Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
Michael:	I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
Andy:	My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
Michel:	Packman.

275.
Michael:	If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Oscar:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Really?
Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration:	You can do it baby!
Michael:	Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Angela:	Safety partners.
Michael:	I'm not giving that to you.
Dwight:	Jethro Tull...
Dwight:	I demand more questions!

276.
Pam:	Just tell me.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl:	Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Yes.

277.
Holly:	It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
Dwight:	I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Kevin:	Yes!
Jim:	Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Ryan:	Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Dwight:	Yours doesn't.
Jim:	[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]

278.
Dwight:	Congratulations.
Man in line:	Sure.
Jim:	Okay.
Michael:	No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Eh, its not that early.
Michael:	Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.

279.
Jim:	Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Angela:	Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
Nick:	What's going on here?
Michael:	Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.

280.
Kevin:	Yes!
Fannie:	Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
David:	Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]

281.
Jim:	Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Phyllis:	Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Dwight:	Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
Jan:	No.
A.J.:	Excuse me?
Dwight:	It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Dwight:	What? Idiot.
Jim:	Thank you.
Dwight:	Interviewer has suspect motives.'
Dwight:	Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Dwight:	Dumatril.

282.
Erin:	Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Lonny:	So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right?
Dwight:	She said she was only sleeping with me.
Dwight:	It's too small.
Oscar:	To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Nellie Bertram:	First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
Dwight:	No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Dwight:	The pressure!  The pressure!
Oscar:	Kevin!
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.

283.
Bar Manager:	What?
Jim:	My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	I don't understand.
Michael:	O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Oscar:	Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	No.

284.
Hannah:	My bag's mostly pencils.
Holly:	Oh I already bought this...
Jim:	Michael, that is hilarious.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Come on.
Dwight:	Okay.
Michael:	I think you're a nice guy too.

285.
Pam:	Oh, great. Thank you.
Michael:	Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Wolf:	I got it. Paintball.
Clark:	No, we got it. We got it.
Isabel:	Whack!
Michael:	No, it's Michael Scott.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	Ohh. May I?
Michael:	Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Michael:	This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Pam:	You're taking away our bathroom?

286.
Michael:	Is it her boobs, or...
Andy:	A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Isabel:	Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Emergency dentist appointment.
Jim:	You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Jim:	Nice. [they bump fists]

287.
Nellie:	I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
Oscar:	Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
Jim:	Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Jim:	You're not having sex.
Michael:	No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

288.
Oscar:	It's not pizza.
Jim:	I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Michael:	I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
Dwight:	It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Michael:	Yes, right in here, come on in.
Jim:	Mmm-hmmm.
Michael:	I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

289.
Stanley:	It's my bio-feedback machine..
Woman 2:	Uh, no.
Pam:	Next on the list - open the mail.
Pam:	Wait, are those Michael's Levis?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	You do?
Michael:	[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	La la la, hello Oscar!
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

290.
Michael:	You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Creed:	No, but I still have my medal from that.
Jim:	All right.

291.
Pam:	Yeah, he is.
Pam:	It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Dwight:	Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Okay.

292.
Meredith:	Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Jim:	No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Jim:	I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Nellie:	This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Pam:	Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?

293.
Oscar:	He did it himself.
Darryl:	Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Michael:	I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	[on microphone] Andy had Erin.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Why
Oscar:	Yes!
Michael:	That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.
Michael:	You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Darryl:	Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.

294.
Jan:	So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Erin:	Well that's a sales desk.
Andy:	Say what?
Michael:	Best friends.
Michael:	Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
Michael:	In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

295.
Dwight:	The bride and groom? What are their names?
Michael:	OK...
Dwight:	When? When did he tell you? Today?
Jim:	[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?

296.
Dwight:	I know.
Erin:	Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Pam:	We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Dwight:	I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
Jim:	Hey, thanks a lot.
Pam:	Can't your other cats keep her company.
Andy:	Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Erin:	Really. It's not a big deal.
Dwight:	And she is your boss.

297.
Dwight:	What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Michael:	Oh, she's great.
Michael:	Ah.
Jim:	[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.

298.
Ryan:	We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Michael:	Okay, well... all settled, then.
Gabe:	What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	God. She left this here?
Michael:	Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.

299.
Dwight:	Eight minutes!
Dwight:	I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Michael:	I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Michael:	What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Kelly:	Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Michael:	Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Dwight:	...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Michael:	[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
Oscar:	Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.

300.
Jim:	Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Michael:	Tonight's so...
Erin:	I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Hunter's CD:	You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

301.
Jim:	Yep, okay...
Michael:	Really?
Kelly:	Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Kevin:	because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Dwight:	Hey.
Michael:	Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]

302.
Dwight:	Exactly.
Jim:	Oh, OK.
Kevin:	We have to.
Cathy:	It's almost too warm.
Dwight:	Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

303.
Oscar:	Yes.
Michael:	What?
Pam:	Oh, no. I just--
Kelly:	Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Angela:	Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Michael:	Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]
Michael:	Take hedded of.
Angela:	Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
Holy:	I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but...
Michael:	Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
Michael:	Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.

304.
Andy:	Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
Andy:	Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Girl:	Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Ok.
Michael:	Good-bye!
Jim:	Hey, how's things?
Michael:	Ok.

305.
Kevin:	Niiice.
Jim:	Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
TV:	And the winner is, by two votes- [TV goes blank]
Andy:	Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?

306.
Female worker:	Okay, Jan will see you now.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	[seeing bird] Oh, God!
DunMiff/sys:	[on monitor] You beat me.  You are the superior being.
Jim:	That would be fun.
Jim:	No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Michael:	Come on, Ryan...
Ryan:	Hey.
Ryan:	You're not gonna find this anywhere else.

307.
Michael:	Well, why don't-
Kelly:	[shaking head] Weird.
Michael:	Yes.
Karen:	Yeah. P and R?
Holly:	Dunder Mifflin.
Michael:	Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Noon.
Michael:	Right. [sighs]
Michael:	Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

308.
Michael:	Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
Oscar:	Hey.
Stanley:	It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
Erin:	Hey.
Pam:	Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.
Michael:	I'm cool.
Pam:	Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
Michael:	[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Good.

309.
Dwight:	Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Everyone:	OH!
Erin:	How was the dentist?
Kevin:	Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?

310.
Darryl:	Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
Dwight:	I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Michael:	Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Karen:	Ooh.
Michael:	And shake! What? Go ahead.
Erin:	Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.

311.
Merv Bronte:	[at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?
Ryan:	Yes, yes, yes!
Ryan:	Uh, is that a vibrator?
Dwight:	You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Holly:	They're warm.
Waiter:	He just left.
Ryan:	Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
Dwight:	I'm kneading it!
Dwight:	Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
Dwight:	This is smaller than your old place.
Holly:	Okay.
Holly:	I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]

312.
Kelly:	It's about a family. A real-life family.
Michael:	[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
Angela:	I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
Toby:	Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

313.
Kevin:	You love your mom.
Andy:	I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Ryan Howard:	Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
Pam:	Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Jim:	Well, the grass is always greener.
Pam:	Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.
Jim:	Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Pam:	Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

314.
Michael:	What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?
Michael:	If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Dwight:	Welcome aboard.
Carroll:	Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.

315.
Phyllis:	So is it an open relationship?
Michael:	Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
Pam:	��� bad.
Andy:	That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
Troy:	If I see him, I'll tell him.
Andy:	The one in the green hoodie.

316.
Dwight:	Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jim:	Not at all, can we go?
Pam:	Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Creed:	[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.

317.
Jim:	No, no, no, Stanley.
Stanley:	Well...
Mr. Halpert:	So, which one is Pam's grandma?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Michael, we only told our parents last week.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

318.
Jim:	Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Dwight:	Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Kevin:	Jim said that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.

319.
Andy:	Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Dwight:	Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
Dwight:	I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Robert California:	Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.
Jim:	Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Dwight:	Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Dwight:	[joins in] Shrute! Shrute!

320.
Creed:	Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Pam:	Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
Pam :	Yeah?
Jan:	After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Kevin:	Croak!
Creed:	I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Pam:	No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
Pam:	It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.

321.
Kevin:	[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

322.
Jim:	I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Lynn:	OK.
Erin:	Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Pam:	[quietly] Not with your hands.
Pam:	No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Pam:	Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]

323.
Dwight:	It's uh, it's in beta testing.
Creed:	We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	You have no idea what you're talking about.

324.
Clark:	Well, uh��� see, you raised it.
Dwight:	He knew all along!
Michael:	Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jim:	Thank you very much. It was fun.
Michael:	After breakfast.
Michael:	I might.
Michael:	Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?

325.
Michael:	Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Kelly:	I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Darryl:	Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Dwight:	I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Michael:	Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
Stanley:	Well...

326.
Michael:	Roy.
Roy:	Hey, man.
Michael:	Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
Concierge:	Tsk... Oh.  Matsuki.  That's a good one.  Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9:00.  Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.
Erin:	There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	[fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I'm with the FBI.

327.
Pam:	In his office. You can go right in.
Jan:	Good luck with your band.
Pam:	New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Michael:	Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Pam:	Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Michael:	What?
Pam:	There's a person here...

328.
Donna:	Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Darryl:	Dwight, come back and spot me.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	Burned my foot, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Jim:	Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Pam:	Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!

329.
Michael:	No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
Nellie:	I will.
Dwight:	Yes.
Michael:	He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
Jim:	Yes. Right now? Yes.
Andy:	I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Dwight:	Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Dwight:	[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
Dwight:	I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.

330.
Phyllis:	Move on, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Get in the van.
Phyllis:	It's just me here.
Michael:	We have a little song prepared for you.
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Dwight:	I'm talking about... hmmm.
Jim:	I know, I know.
Michael:	[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
Ryan:	Hey.

331.
Pam:	I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
Stanley:	Well...

332.
Kevin:	OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
Billy Merchant:	Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park
Andy:	They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Nail manager:	Two men? [other nail stylist speaks Korean to manager, both laugh] [gestures index fingers bumping together] Doesn't work. No discount.
Oscar:	No, no, please. Please do not do this.

333.
Jim:	Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Meredith:	We have.
Michael:	Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Dwight:	Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
Jim:	Ok, I said average.
Dwight:	That suit is amazing.

334.
Michael:	What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Ryan:	Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Enngh-
Pam:	That's right.
Jim:	I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Jim:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Andy:	Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.

335.
Andy:	We'll use code names.
Michael:	Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Oscar:	Yeah.
Dwight:	I'm pumped!
Karen:	Yeah, thanks.
Dwight:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Oscar:	It was an amateur production, technically.

336.
Suit Store Father:	Ahh���
Jan:	Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Bring it on guys.
Andy:	I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
Michael:	No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
Jim:	Yeah?

337.
Michael:	Cool, cool. Box it up.
Ryan:	New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Investor:	Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me.
Pam:	Hi, can I help you?
Michael:	Would she get into trouble?
Mr. Schofield:	Really?
Pam:	I thought we were having a nice time.
Michael:	Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.

338.
David:	No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
Nurse:	Yeah, she'll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
Pam:	How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Isaac:	[interviewee enters office] Hello.
Michael:	Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Michael:	I'm going in for a procedure today.
Michael:	No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Pam:	That was funny.
Pam:	Because he accomplished something.

339.
Michael:	Why... why are you making this so hard?
Kevin:	Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Dwight:	Let's do this thing.
Oscar:	Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
Nellie:	I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
Dwight:	More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
Michael:	Good to see you.
Michael:	[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Julie:	Good. Hi.
Michael:	What? What?

340.
Pam:	Thanks.
Dwight:	Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Michael:	No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
Ryan and Kelly:	I don't think I should be married to you anymore.

341.
Karen:	Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
Michael:	I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Pam:	Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
Angela:	That's why we're cursed.
Pam:	I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Angela:	You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Pam:	Okay, okay.
Pam:	Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

342.
Pam:	That���s sweet that he talks about me.
Creed:	Yeah.
Mary-Beth:	How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here?
Helene:	No.  I'm 58.
Karen:	Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Pam:	No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Pam:	Mmm, hmm.

343.
Suit Store Son:	That���s right.
Nellie:	Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Jan:	Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
Kevin:	One order.
Chad Lite:	Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---
Nellie:	Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Nellie:	Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
Kevin:	I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
Kevin:	Make it go taller.

344.
Andy:	You bet.
Isabel:	Hello stranger.  How do I look?
Children:	[ringing the doorbell of Michael's Condo] Trick or treat!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

345.
Dwight:	Spoken like a true root man.
Pam:	Yeah, I could read it.
Holly:	10 dollars.
Dwight:	There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Jim:	Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
Jim:	[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Meredith:	Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]

346.
Director:	The actor's crying.
Toby:	You're-you're not in it.
Kevin:	Pete...
Pete:	That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?

347.
Andy:	I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Pam:	This is a new cardigan.
Michael:	[walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
Michael:	Yeah, tell me about it.
Michael:	That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

348.
Kelly:	Andy, that was just the ice.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Pam:	I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Jim:	Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Kelly:	I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
Jim:	[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
Pam:	Yes. He was a good spy.
Jim:	I outran it.

349.
Dwight:	Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Bert:	Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.
Michael:	Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
Michael:	Well...
Michael:	No, this is my quest.
Pam:	Oh, okay...
Jim:	It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Jim:	Five movies. Go ahead.
Pam:	Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
Pam:	So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
Michael:	Oh, here we go.

350.
Meredith:	Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Oh yeah?
Andy:	I'm your wingman.
Andy:	Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Jim:	Hey, how are you?
Michael:	I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Andy:	Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

351.
Michael:	Okay, all right.
Pam:	Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Angela:	I would very much like that.
Angela:	Some of us got both. [raises hand]
Andy:	You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
Michael:	Hey. How's everybody doing?
Pam:	I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Angela:	[whispering]

352.
Pam:	Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Deangelo:	No.  Because the entire state smells like Earth.
Michael:	Ah, so when did you set up shop?
Michael:	What old days? What are you talking about?
Dwight:	I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.

353.
Andy:	[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Roy:	You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
Michael:	Night Erin.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Erin:	Well I have an idea.
Michael:	Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan:	Hey.
Ryan:	Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Everyone:	OH!

354.
Dwight:	That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Pam:	I'm not making any copies.
Pam:	Ten minutes.
Pam:	Hey Kelly.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Andy:	You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
Andy:	What are you thinking?
Chef:	No, it's Usuba.
Andy:	Are they from you?
Dwight:	Okay!
Dwight:	[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.

355.
Jim:	Let's... eh... see ya.
Michael:	Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	Explain that.
Michael:	Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?

356.
Phyllis:	Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Bob:	Yes!
Jim:	You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
Darryl:	And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?

357.
All:	[chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
Michael:	Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Helen:	Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.
Hank:	I don't know what that is.
All:	What?
Michael:	Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm]

358.
Dwight:	Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
Michael:	[as Mikanos] Hello.
Oscar:	Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
Michael:	Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Michael:	My heart says...
Angela:	Yeah, uh no.

359.
Holly:	How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Angela:	[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

360.
Dwight:	Okay��� Seven, one, one, nine���
Andy:	That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Jim:	Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Everyone:	No. No!
Jim:	Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Dwight:	Hey, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

361.
Dwight:	You know what you need? Closure.
Dwight:	[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Dwight:	Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Phyllis:	If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Jim:	No one wants to be you, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

362.
Oscar:	I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Ryan:	At these prices with this service...
Andy:	Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Diane:	Toby?
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

363.
Jim:	Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Angela:	I can play.
Jim:	No, that is what I mean.
Toby:	I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
Dwight:	At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Jim:	Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Dwight:	Cause I could look it up real easily.
Jim:	65. Ok, no need to laugh.

364.
Jim:	Okay... [changes back to Glee]
Dwight:	Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Could I have a copy of one of them?
Pam:	Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Paris:	Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.
Jim:	Oh, great.

365.
Dwight:	What do you want!?!
Jim:	Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Kevin:	Hey!
Meredith:	I think it looks good.
Jim:	This is dangerous.
Meredith:	You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.

366.
Pam:	I'll leave a message.
Jim:	Kev, have a good weekend.
Dwight:	Two charges of loitering,
Dwight:	It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Potential, lots of potential. yes.
Jim:	Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

367.
Erin:	Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Holly:	No touching.
Michael:	Well, then he's not a senator.
Dwight:	I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.
Michael:	There an accident? Somebody hurt?
Michael:	Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Dwight:	Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Erin:	Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

368.
Andy:	That's so beautiful.
Angela:	Why are you doing this to Andy?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Michael:	Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
Ryan:	[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.

369.
Michael:	I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Stanley:	Well...
Pizza guy:	I can hear you, man.
Jim:	[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.

370.
Manager:	You have to put your clothes back on. People are trying to eat.
Erin:	Good morning.
Phyllis:	I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Michael:	Grenadine.
Darryl:	Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Michael:	You have no idea what you're talking about.
Michael:	I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
Erin:	No.
Michael:	OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
Michael:	Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.

371.
Val:	Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Manager:	Right now.
Park Ranger:	Uh, I haven't heard of that one.
Ryan:	Yeah! That was the idea.
Michael:	Damn it Kevin, come on.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	Ok, ok...
Michael:	It is.
Michael:	You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
Michael:	[laughs at the stupidity]

372.
Teddy:	Yeah. [high-five each other]
Pam:	Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
Michael:	Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Karen:	It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Andy:	Class is canceled, everybody out!

373.
Holly:	That is correct!
Kelly:	That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
Jim:	Wow, that's a lot of keys.
Erin:	Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

374.
Pam:	Angela as the nurse!
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Pam:	No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Jim:	You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Kevin:	This is getting weird.
Michael:	Mm hmm .
Jim:	Yeah, yeah.
Michael:	Just-what's going on?
Jim:	I surrender.

375.
Angela:	[still sobbing]
Michael:	But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Michael:	Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Angela:	[nods]
Pete:	Yeah.

376.
Michael:	I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Phyllis:	Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Creed:	I'm having a little trouble motivating.
Pam:	[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
Pam :	Yeah?
Michael:	Oh, stop it Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Pam:	There's no yelling in that, either.

377.
Jo:	Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.
Dwight:	He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
Dwight:	[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

378.
Nellie:	Get her out.
Bar Manager:	Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.
Holly:	[playing cards] It's time to go.
Andy:	That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Andy:	[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
Andy:	He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
Andy:	Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Andy:	Oh D!
Andy:	You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--

379.
Michael:	And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Erin:	The movies. I don't know.
Dwight:	Do you have the Sharpie?!
Angela:	On it!
Erin:	Sorry.
Dwight:	Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Dwight:	Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
Dwight:	Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Michael:	You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Dwight:	It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.

380.
Andy:	My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
Dwight:	No, I can't... I ca...
Daryl:	[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
Michael:	Oh, she's great.
Kelly:	You're such a ditz.
Dwight:	It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
Michael:	No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.

381.
Val:	All right guys, clear out.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	Tom Brokaw!
Tom:	Hey, future baby sis!

382.
Brian:	Yeah, it is.
Gabe:	I'm such a klutz!
Ravi:	Are you sure you don���t wanna go in?
Dwight:	I am ready for my performance review.
Michael:	I can't, I can't...
Michael:	I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
Dwight:	...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Michael:	Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Michael:	You get something good this year?
Dwight:	It's only twenty-five bucks.

383.
Nurse:	Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
Michael:	Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
Meredith:	What���s with the blanket?
Angela:	He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Lady:	Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
Michael:	It would look good, on my mantle.
Michael:	Okay. Thank you.

384.
Gabe:	Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Toby:	...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Jan:	Are the cameras with you...
Jan:	Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Angela:	What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'

385.
Pam:	Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
David:	Stephanie, can you hop off please?
Stephanie:	David Wallace's office.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

386.
Dwight:	And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Darryl:	Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Jordan:	Dwight?  Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
Deangelo:	I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.

387.
Angela:	Oh my god!
Michael:	Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Kevin:	Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Dwight:	I know.
Toby:	Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Michael:	Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.

388.
Jim:	Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Jim:	Yeah.
Val:	Brandon!
Brandon:	How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss]
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Michael:	I'm not saying that's what he said.

389.
Kevin:	Yeah.
Andy:	No.
Dwight:	Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
Stanley:	Well...
Phyllis:	I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Michael:	All right, attention everyone.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	Okay. So yeah.

390.
Michael:	She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Oscar:	I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Nellie:	Good night Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Angela:	I guess I have.  Huh.
Andy:	What?
Michael:	What?
Michael:	We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

391.
Jo:	[to Dwight] Hello.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Andy:	Mmm.
Michael:	Get out.

392.
Angela:	That's enough.
Pam:	Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Jim:	[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Cece:	[crying]
Andy:	Pull the poop out of the toilets.

393.
Andy:	Football cream. Grr!
Dwight:	Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Jim:	No, we're good. Thank you, though.
Pam:	Ugh...

394.
Dwight:	Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Phyllis:	[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
Photographer:	[shoots twice]
David:	Just let me know.

395.
Gabe:	Shove his sashimi!
Everyone:	[overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can���t have nonsense.
Andy:	So you had a bad day...
Jim:	You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Angela:	Let me know.
Angela:	Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.

396.
Angela:	They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

397.
Val:	Calm down, he's not.
Jim:	No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Oh my God, he hates me!

398.
Dwight:	Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
Holly:	Okay.
Senator Lipton:	I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
Dwight:	All right!
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
Michael:	That's insane!
Dwight:	We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?

399.
Dwight:	Uh, better ask Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?

400.
Jim:	Okay, you know what?
Todd Packer:	Pacman need a drinky.
Phyllis:	Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
Michael:	Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]
Jim:	What are you doing here?

401.
Jim:	I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Jan:	He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Dwight:	Don't make me fire you.
Michael:	Here... Who's here?
Kelly:	She looks awful.
Dwight:	[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
Dwight:	Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Mose:	But you promised.
Michael:	You want one of your own? I can hook you up.

402.
Erin:	No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Michael:	You listen to me. You listen good. You are are
Angela:	We think you might kill Robert.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.

403.
Michael:	You're right. That's good.
Jim:	And of course, classy.
Dwight:	Thank you.
Angela:	Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.

404.
David:	Hi Michael how are you?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	That���s kind of an impossible question.
Jim:	Cece!
Cece:	[crying]
Jessica:	I'll let him know.
Michael:	Ok, alright.
Michael:	Good luck. One of a kind.
Michael:	[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.

405.
Jim:	Not now, Toby, my God!
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Jo:	All that's just birthday information, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Toby:	Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.

406.
Kelly:	Is Ryan going?
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Stanley:	Well...
Dwight:	Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?

407.
Andy:	I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
Toby:	Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
Dwight:	Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Andy:	Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Ad guy 2:	Okay, when should we come back?
Andy:	He does your laundry?
Ryan:	I can't believe I started the fire.
Dwight:	Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Dwight:	That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]

408.
David:	Hello everyone.
Dwight:	It was pretty awesome.
Kelly:	Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.
Michael:	When did this happen?
Dwight:	Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Dwight:	Come on.

409.
Michael:	And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
Jim:	Perfect.
Phyllis:	[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Dwight:	A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Mose:	But you promised.
Pam:	No you're not.
Dwight:	What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.

410.
Michael:	Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
GPS:	Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
Angela:	Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Jim:	And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Michael:	Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
Jim:	Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
Jim:	Oh... Good.

411.
Gabe:	Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Darryl:	There's other pencil's in this office.
Darryl:	It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
Darryl:	Hey!
Michael:	No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.

412.
Michael:	So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.
Michael:	I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Packer:	I will be here.
Erin:	What you doing?
Dwight:	Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Jim:	I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
Dwight:	I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.

413.
Phyllis:	When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Pam:	Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	Yes.  I am an accountant.

414.
Deangelo:	I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
Michael:	Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.

415.
Holly:	...Hell yeah.
Pam:	Yes.
Ryan:	I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
Pam:	[sighs]
Roy:	Come on, you mad at me?
Dwight:	Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
Dwight:	OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Dwight:	The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
Dwight:	Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Pam:	Mm-hmm.
Dwight:	It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
Pam:	Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.

416.
Michael:	I'm writing one, yeah.
Pam:	Maybe. One step at a time.
Jim:	Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Michael:	Look-
Jim:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Michael:	Ok. Thank you.

417.
Pam:	Wow...
Michael:	Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Mr. Brown:	Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.
Creed:	Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
Andy:	I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
Michael:	Oh, after you.
Michael:	Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Stanley:	Well...
Andy:	Get out of my way, Jim!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

418.
Jim:	Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Michael:	Why did you do that?
Pam:	Okay.
Dwight:	Not my style.

419.
Curtis:	You guys sound great, man.
Dwight:	Could I have a copy of one of them?
Michael:	Uh-huh.
Dwight:	Gotcha! Why are you late?
Clark:	Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
Michael:	Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Dwight:	Nope.
Michael:	My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Michael:	And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.

420.
Dwight:	[agreeing] Mm.
Jim:	That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Jim:	Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

421.
All:	Awww.
Dwight:	Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Dwight:	Pssht.
Andy:	Through the use of force.
Andy:	No time to chat.
Dwight:	Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Ben Franklin:	Yes, but I don't.  My name is Gordon.
Oscar:	We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.

422.
Pam:	Michael, what's wrong?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Justin:	Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of...

423.
Michael:	Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
Darryl:	Sup?
Stanley:	I was.
Michael:	No, this is geological.
Michael:	It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.
Michael:	No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
Darryl:	[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.

424.
Toby:	Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Helene:	You want to go snowboarding?
Dwight:	No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.
Michael:	Nice to have Oscar back.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?

425.
Stanley:	Okay, I need a drink.
Michael:	So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Justin:	Cool.
Erin:	Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.

426.
Jim:	You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Michael:	No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Andy:	I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Angela:	What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
Michael:	No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.

427.
Michael:	And tolerance.
Kevin:	[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Michael:	Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
Michael:	What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
Jim:	But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Jim:	I think you mean a girl's
Michael:	And you're okay with that?
Meredith:	Where are we? This ain't my street.

428.
Andy:	Then... what are you saying?
Phyllis:	Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Bob:	Yes!
Erin:	Yes.
Dwight:	[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
Lady:	Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
Dwight:	I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	No.

429.
Angela:	Oh. [hands Pam tape]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael and Christian:	No.
Jim:	You've been gone for a long time.
Michael:	Hey, Buttercup.

430.
Phyllis:	Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Bob:	Yes!
Oscar:	[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
Toby:	Fun?

431.
Dwight:	Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Kathy:	Kathy.
Chares:	Okay, striker, huh?
Dwight:	Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Angela:	Pam, we have a great idea.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	You're welcome.

432.
Erin:	[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Jim:	What's that?
Dwight:	Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
Michael:	What is up with you two, Holly?
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Dwight:	Got it.
Michael:	Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
Friend:	Oh, my God.  Ok.  Everybody just act normal.  Don't say anything.

433.
Andy:	Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Michael:	And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
Andy:	Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Dwight:	Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Angela:	Uh-huh.
Toby:	Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Dwight:	Numb me up. I want anesthesia!

434.
Michael:	No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
Michael:	Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
Pam:	You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
Daryl:	[opens the door the Ryan's office, grabs him by the shirt, pulls him out of his chair] Consider it a WUPHF in person. [shoves Ryan down to a chair]
Ryan:	Hey.

435.
Pam:	When-
Erin:	[quietly] What?
Kevin:	Oh, man!
Jan:	Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Jim:	[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Pam:	I don't have anybody.
Kevin:	Good thinking.

436.
Michael:	Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
Jim:	Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
Ryan:	Hey.
Meredith:	Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
Dwight:	Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.

437.
Darryl:	Processed.
Phyllis:	Oh, it's coming.
Dwight:	Can I do some of the talking?
Michael:	You're right. That's good.
Michael:	A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
Angela:	Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
Michael:	Yeah?
Dwight:	Okay, that is
Dwight:	You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
Cathy:	Hi.

438.
Dwight:	Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Mose:	But you promised.
Stanley:	Yep, looks that way.
Jim:	What brings you to town?
Dwight:	It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
Dwight:	The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.

439.
Karen:	Hey dummy, get in the car!
Jim:	Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Michael:	Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	No.
Michael:	No, this is geological.
Meredith:	I'll take the teapot.
Michael:	Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Jim:	What���s going on?
Jim:	You called any headhunters?

440.
Michael:	Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
Jim:	Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
Jim:	Alright. I will definitely do that.
Erin:	Erin123'
Pam:	I could get us a complaint.
Pam:	Maybe.

441.
Michael:	Well that goes without saying.
Michael:	Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	I don't want her to get away.

442.
Michael:	Yeah, you took it too slow.
Dwight:	God!
Jim:	Oh yeah.
Phyllis:	We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
Alan:	Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions.
Jim:	Yikes.
Phyllis:	Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

443.
Blood Girl:	A hat with no blood in it?
Ex-client:	Yeah it was mine!
Clark:	Aw, come on.
Jim:	Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Phyllis:	It's a secret.
Jim:	You know, try sending them another invoice.
Phyllis:	Oh, we're in a meeting.
Clark:	Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Jim:	Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Clark:	[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-

444.
Jim:	Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Michael:	Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
Michael:	Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?
Michael:	[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
Ryan:	So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Dwight:	Loyalty.
Jim:	Dwight, come o-
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Julia:	You must be freezing.
Michael:	Who quits?
Michael:	Ryan?
Ryan:	Hey.

445.
Andy:	That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Angela:	[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.
Andy:	[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.

446.
Ben Franklin:	But I kept all this from my wife Deborah.  These things only serve to upset the women.  They are the gentler sex.
Jim:	It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.

447.
Helene:	[reading]  I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...
Nellie:	And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Meredith:	Grow up.
Michael:	She was from Europe.
Jim:	What?
Michael:	Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

448.
Angela:	Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Darryl:	Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
Dwight:	Are those real pearls?
Michael:	[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Dwight:	Like Angela in accounting.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

449.
Michael:	A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Ryan:	Hey.
Dwight:	What?
Pam:	[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Dwight:	That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Michael:	Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.

450.
Michael:	I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
Jim:	Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Pam:	Straight.
Jim:	Really?
Michael:	Don't...
Andy:	Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-

451.
Rose:	Okay!
Security:	No.
Dwight:	Ha! I don't get it.
Ryan:	Wait, can you go back?
Pam:	Cute.

452.
Michael:	Good.
Dwight:	Oh.  Meh.
Pam:	Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
Dwight:	So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

453.
Fred Henry:	Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
Toby:	I would love that.
Creed:	Just doing my job, guys.
Michael:	Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	Why do you hate her?
Michael:	So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Michael:	Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
Michael:	There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.

454.
Jim:	OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Ryan:	Hey.
Producer:	Yeah.
Michael:	How much time do you think you'll need?
Michael:	[moves chair to Jim and Dwight's desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	Yeah. Yeah.

455.
Dwight:	Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Kevin:	Oscar. Angela.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Erin:	Who���s calling?
Darryl:	Like what?
Angela:	Fifty.
Dwight:	There's so much more to it than that.
Kevin:	Wait a minute. Yes I am.

456.
Michael:	On the phone.
Danny:	Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Which one's this? Perfect.
Toby:	No.
Michael:	Think of it as part of your training.
Michael:	[shakes head] Okay...
Toby:	Come on.
Michael:	The best.
Michael:	Guys, guys-

457.
Michael:	We ought to have this thing serviced.
Katy:	I should probably get back to my table.
Michael:	You're close with Pam too.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
Michael:	Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Erin:	Hey.
Michael:	I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.

458.
Daryl:	I impressed her with my good ideas.
Michael:	I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	Um, how many people are you interviewing?
Bob Vance:	Mind if I steal my wife?
Jim:	Oh no?
Michael:	Hi.
Michael:	Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
Jim:	Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Jim:	Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?

459.
Pam:	Thank you.
Waiter:	[pointing to each correct person] Ryan, Pam, Stanley, Kelly, Kevin, Creed. How'd I do?
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
Angela:	You put her in my freezer.
Michael:	That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
Pam:	Wow.
Michael:	Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]

460.
Jim:	Yeah, you never know.
Pam:	A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Pam:	No one.
Michael:	Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
Michael:	You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Jim:	And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Jim:	[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Michael:	It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
Michael:	That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.

461.
Jan:	Bye Babe!
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Roy:	Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
Dwight:	Okay. [sits]
Dwight:	No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Dwight:	Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Dwight:	That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.

462.
Kevin:	Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Oscar:	How mean are we talking about?
Jim:	All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Why are you telling us this?
Jim:	Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
Pam:	You bought me a house!
Oscar:	Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Pam:	I got it.
Pam:	We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
Pam:	Is it called Ghostbusters?

463.
Holly:	Thanks.
Michael:	Don't...
Dana:	Here you go.
Kelly:	She's 23.
Andy:	[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
Andy:	Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.

464.
Speaker:	A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	: Yes. And yes. [chuckles]

465.
Dwight:	Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Jim:	So now you're writing two things?
Jim:	Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Mark:	Hey, you must be Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

466.
Oscar:	Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Dwight:	I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Michael:	Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Kevin:	Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
Michael:	So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.

467.
Pam:	Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Creed:	Huh?
Darryl:	I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Dwight:	Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.

468.
Kelly:	So unnecessary.
Dwight:	Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Kelly:	Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
Dwight:	Oh my God, we have to be there.
Pam:	Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
Pam:	Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Pam:	[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
Michael:	Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.

469.
Erin:	Andy?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	That's really not cool.
Michael:	Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	Yes.
Jim:	Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Michael:	[laughs] Which one is that again?
Michael:	Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Michael:	[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...

470.
Andy:	[at dump] It's freezing out here.
Kevin:	I can do that.
Dwight:	What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Pam:	What should we do now?
Phyllis:	Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Bob:	Yes!
Andy:	Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam:	Sure, no problem.
Dwight:	It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

471.
Pam:	��� bad.
Dwight:	I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Michael:	Ok. I love it. I love it.
Pam:	That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.

472.
Jim:	You have to make the decision.
Michael:	Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?
Michael:	So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
Stanley:	Well...
Craig:	Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?

473.
Michael:	I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
Erin:	Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Pam:	Absolutely, I do.
Michael:	That is not what Wallace told us.
Dwight:	I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!

474.
Darryl:	So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Phyllis:	Let me get you some water.
Michael:	Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Michael:	[entering break room] Who's getting married?
Michael:	Let's go mini-golfing.
Michael:	That would be sublime.
Pam:	[laughs] I wish.
Michael:	Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.
Everyone:	OH!
Pam:	Let's just calm down.
Michael:	Hey, don't touch him, please!

475.
Dwight:	So you excited?
Kevin:	Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Jim:	Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Andy:	What?
Toby:	So you have played it before?
Dwight:	Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
Rose:	No, that's not part of it.

476.
Roy:	Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Angela:	I said, okay.
Jim:	I didn't forget them, they're right here.

477.
Michael:	Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Andy:	Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Michael:	...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
Erin:	Wow!
Deangelo:	Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.

478.
Michael:	Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Oscar:	It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Kevin:	Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Ryan:	I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.

479.
Phil Maguire:	Guy's kind of a douche.
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Michael:	Um, not personally, no.
Ryan:	Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Kendall:	[on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

480.
Meredith:	This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Erin:	I'm hungry.
Michael:	Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
Pam:	Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
Grotti:	Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?

481.
Ryan:	So, how are you?
Dwight:	Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Dwight:	Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	Five o'clock.  Time to go get my improv on. [drinks]  Little bit of the comedy juice.  Mmm.  Alright, see if you can guess what this is. [roars and flails his arms]  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.  Just a taste of the improv.
Jim:	Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
Michael:	[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?
Michael:	Per diem.

482.
Dwight:	Oh, you're kidding me!
Holly:	[as Curly] I most certainly am.
Laurie:	Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.
Dwight:	Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Susan:	For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Dwight:	Because you're engaged to Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]

483.
Pam's Mom:	Oh, my goodness. That's great.
Michael:	Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Gabe:	The puzzle is the clue.
Jim:	You ready?
Michael:	Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
Jim:	I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

484.
Angela:	Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Don't drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	65. Ok, no need to laugh.

485.
Michael:	What?
Pam:	Hi.
Pam:	I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Nellie Bertram:	First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
Michael:	Oh, you wanna go today?
Michael:	Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'

486.
Jim:	Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
Gabe:	[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Andy:	Do me! Do me!
Michael:	I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
Dan:	And that about does it, thank you.
Michael:	Go, here we go!
Jim:	I don't know. I don't know.
Michael:	Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.

487.
Erin:	And, you're my friend.
Jim:	[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Billy Merchant:	Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time...
Dwight:	In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Jim:	Did you feel like crying?
Pam:	Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Dwight:	She probably scrubbed it
Dwight:	[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]

488.
Jim:	No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Michael:	Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
Pam:	Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Ronnie:	Does anyone want to dance?
Jim:	Hey.
Michael:	I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
Pam:	[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.
Pam:	You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

489.
Oscar:	It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Donna:	It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Michael:	Sounds awesome.

490.
Michael:	Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
Michael:	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Michael:	Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
Phyllis:	My mom taught me that.
Kevin:	So, there was talk of oatmeal.

491.
Jake:	Is your job hard?
Dwight:	Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Kevin:	Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Angela:	[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Angela:	I said, okay.

492.
Andy:	No!
Michael:	I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
Andy:	Not guy friends?
Jim:	Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

493.
Dwight:	Yes, please.
Pam:	Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Ryan:	So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Michael:	One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
Stanley:	Well...
Dwight:	Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
Michael:	Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.

494.
Darryl:	My bad.
Michael:	Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
Andy:	I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
Dwight:	Okay.
Mr. Brown:	Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?

495.
Nellie:	Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Good.
Michael:	Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
Nellie:	Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Jim:	Mm-hmm.
Michael:	I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

496.
Ryan:	Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Dwight:	Blah.
Clark:	This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Dwight:	No, no. Give me the steam.
Michael:	You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Jim:	Yeah, bigger actually.

497.
Michael:	[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.
Michael:	Hey.
David:	Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
Andy:	Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
Michael:	Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.
Dwight:	What?
Jim:	Mmmkay...
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]

498.
Pam:	What's wrong?
Jim:	Yeah...
Michael:	Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
Worker:	Jim, limo's here.

499.
Michael:	An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	Maybe we should get some air.
Stanley:	I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Jim:	Not bad.

500.
Dwight:	Thank you.
Andy:	Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
Toby:	...building looked into...
Shirley:	Time to get clean!
Dwight:	[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
Dwight:	N... it's complicated.
Kevin:	Hey, Jo!
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Creed:	Hank, his name is Hank.

501.
Phyllis:	Mmm-hmm.
Phyllis:	I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Jim:	Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Jim:	... MICHAEL!
Michael:	Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
Gabe:	Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.

502.
Jim:	[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Oh no. I was just -
Women:	One... Two... Three. Ahhhh! [Phyllis throws the flowers, Ryan knocks them out of Kelly's hands, Toby's date gets them]
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.

503.
Dwight:	We'll see.
Erin:	People say you cry all the time.
Robert:	[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
Pam:	Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
Andy:	The cost of doing business.
Pam:	Oh, well, Thursday���s tough, because of���
Andy:	Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Andy:	I cannot believe you're still up!
Robert:	I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
Dwight:	Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Andy:	Big day for you.

504.
Pam:	Okay.
Michael:	What?
Michael:	I am not budging on the hat issue.
Andy:	[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	Good me too!
Jim:	OK.
Pam:	Ok. Sure.

505.
Erin:	We've already rescheduled seven times.
Andy:	You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
Tony:	Uh... this is difficult, for me.
Michael:	Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
Jim:	Hey, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Erin:	Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

506.
Michael:	We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
Michael:	Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
Ryan:	Hey.

507.
Jan:	No, that's not---
Dwight:	Cmon.
Jim:	To both these bears.
Meredith:	I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Jim:	Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

508.
Jim:	You all right? What���s going on?
Michael:	[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?
Michael:	[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Oscar:	...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Lonny:	So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right?
Ronnie:	Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie.
Michael:	Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Michael:	How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?

509.
Andy:	News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.
Michael:	Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Julius:	Yeah, you show me how.
Oscar:	What are you doing?
Michael:	You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
Andy:	[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in]
Michael:	No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
Stanley:	Well...
Andy:	We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?

510.
Holly:	[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
Michael:	Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin:	Or the me that stinks.
Mr. Brown:	Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Dwight:	Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Michael:	Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Holly:	I'm Robert Dunder.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.

511.
Pam:	I do not.
Ryan:	Yeah.
Michael:	No.
Dwight:	Whassup.
Dwight:	Whassup!
Everyone:	[quiet and scattered] To waiting.
Pam:	Ok, you've got to pull it together.
Michael:	Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
Luke:	Coffee Monkey's arrived.
Dwight:	Go ahead. Don't lie.

512.
Pam:	[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	We won't let you down.
Shane:	Okay.
Dwight:	Where's your tie?
Jim:	Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Pam:	Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
Andy:	Yes, a madhouse.
Pam:	I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.

513.
David Wallace's Secretary:	I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	���..breast pain...���
Dwight:	Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Michael:	[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Michael:	Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Carol:	Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

514.
Ryan:	Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Dwight:	I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Oscar:	What time do we have to come in?
Jim:	There's a table over here.
Ryan:	This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Dwight:	Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Jim:	Nope.
Dwight:	Get up off your desks!
Dwight:	Having trouble finding a vein?
Jim:	Oh, would you look at that.
Jim:	What?

515.
Billy Merchant:	And leave.
Dwight:	Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Dwight:	Erin....the receptionist!
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	What?
Michael:	Forget that.
Dwight:	Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?

516.
Oscar:	I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
Dwight:	New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Stanley:	Well...
Pete:	It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.

517.
Andy:	Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
Dwight:	I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Carol:	What are you talking about?
Mr. Ramish:	Every salesman I���ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Dwight:	I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Andy:	Who are your role models?
Pam:	I know.
Dwight:	Were you absent?
Pam:	Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
Andy:	Why? Why? [looks at Jim]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

518.
Michael:	[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.
Michael:	I wasn't.
Michael:	Yes, sir.
Dwight:	Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Ryan:	Good.

519.
Michael:	That's a lot of zeroes.
Erin:	Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	OK, great.
Darryl:	Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]

520.
Dwight:	I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Dwight:	Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Michael:	Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
David:	What say we do.
Dwight:	Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Jim:	I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Michael:	Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Andy:	God, Toby, don���t���stop blocking my hand.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

521.
Michael:	Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pete:	That���s really nice.
Jim:	Well guys with girlfriends don't.
Andy:	All right, who���s next? Nellie?
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Andy:	I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Andy:	Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
Andy:	Who'd you get?

522.
Dwight:	Please?
Angela:	Okay. Oh, thank you.
Michael:	Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Okay, okay. Um...
Michael:	Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Dwight:	Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!

523.
Pete:	No I���m not.
Michael:	It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Charles:	Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Charles:	Okay.
Jo:	Yeah, I want to hear more from you.

524.
Jo:	Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Yeah.
Jim:	[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.

525.
Deangelo:	Try it without using your name.
Jim:	I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	You are welcome.
Angela:	Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Andy:	I actually had that down in the cons column, but...

526.
Kevin:	[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Where do I want to go?
Michael:	Hey, sport.
Soldier:	Dearest mother I���m sorry it has been so long since my last letter.  It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive.  Melvin Fifer Garris.
Jim:	Yeah.
Pam:	This is terrible.
Michael:	Sits on a copier.
Pam:	Don't.

527.
Kevin:	Six-six-five-zero.
Michael:	Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
Meredith:	Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Jim:	Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Pam:	Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Jim:	What's that?
Michael:	Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Kevin:	That's awesome!
Jim:	Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]

528.
Dwight:	Whassup!
Stanley:	I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Captain Jack:	Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
Michael:	Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
Michael:	[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.
Dwight:	Whoa. Michael.

529.
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Dwight:	Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Jim:	At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	You are relieved.
Dwight:	Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
Michael:	Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Michael:	Well.
Jim:	Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Michael:	Ah.

530.
Dwight:	[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Jim:	You up for a game?
Receptionist:	Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.
Andy:	Because we could get some food...
Tattoo Artist:	Baby���
Andy:	Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
Jim:	Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Jim:	What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Jim:	[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.

531.
Holly:	Sorry, Darryl.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Michael:	Ahh, ooh!
Oscar:	U..s..a. U-
Phyllis:	Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...

532.
Oscar:	Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
Toby:	Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Andy:	I didn���t do anything any of you wouldn���t have done.
Andy:	My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
Michel:	Packman.
Dwight:	I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
Oscar:	I have a very strong suspicion.
Dwight:	And your veil.
Andy:	Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Kelly:	Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.

533.
Michael:	[shaking head disgustedly] Okay... okay. [leaves room]
Host:	I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.
Einsteins:	Whoo!
Andy:	Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	Hi, Oscar its Michael.

534.
Andy:	Yeah.
Mark:	You're not.
Darryl:	Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
Everyone:	OH!
Kevin:	Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Andy:	What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
Kevin:	What?
Darryl:	I can videotape it.
Darryl:	Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
Bob:	Yes!

535.
Stanley:	He can top that.'
Pam:	Hey!
Michael:	[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
Michael:	Got it. It works.
Charles:	God, no.
Pam:	Well, I kind of liked Legal...
Karen:	Thanks.

536.
Michael:	Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Charles:	Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

537.
Creed:	Thanks mom.
Dwight:	What's this?
Pam:	I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?

538.
Gabe:	[Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

539.
Darryl:	It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
Roy:	Hey, man.
Michael:	I owe you an apology.
Officer 2:	The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Phyllis:	Oh, boy... You...
Michael:	This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Mr. Schofield:	Michael, good to see you.

540.
Michael:	This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
Jim:	Yeah!
Andy:	Come on, get over here.
Dwight:	Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
Creed:	Huh?
Andy:	Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

541.
Angela:	Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
Meredith:	No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Angela:	I can't do it.
Jim:	Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Oscar:	Dwight has a sister?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Kev, c'mon.

542.
Karen:	Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
Dwight:	Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Andy:	And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Michael:	It's- that's different.

543.
Dwight:	Not! [scoffs]
Dwight:	Damn it!
Erin:	I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
Erin:	Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Pam:	[on phone] hey!

544.
Holly:	The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Michael:	Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
Jan:	[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
Dwight:	So?
Michael:	Okay, all right.
Kelly:	This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
Jan:	Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?

545.
Dwight:	No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Dwight:	Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Dwight:	Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	It could be kind of funny.
Ryan:	Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Okay.
Vikram:	Well this is your home.
Jim:	Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Jim:	Is your password Frodo?
Dwight:	Jan's here.

546.
Michael:	I'll call you later.
Nellie:	Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Michael:	Hey Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Phyllis:	But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Michael:	Yeah?
Michael:	Thanks.
Phyllis:	You are...

547.
Michael:	That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Oscar:	[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

548.
Pam:	Kay.
Jim:	Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Phil Maguire:	[takes golf swing] Whoa!
Michael:	Very valid.
Michael:	People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
Bob:	Yes!

549.
Phyllis:	You are a pervert!
Erin:	Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Jan:	[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

550.
Sasha:	So, do you have any kids?
Toby:	Well let me see... I would, uh...
Phyllis:	I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
Michael:	The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.

551.
Phyllis:	Let me help you us.
Dwight:	No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Michael:	[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Jim:	Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Dwight:	What is a scented candle?
Kevin:	I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Michael:	Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.

552.
Dwight:	I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Gabe:	Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
Dwight:	All you have to do it say it.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Host:	All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Yeah.
Jim:	What is that?
Jim:	What are you reading?
Dwight:	Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.

553.
Andy:	Was that hot or what?
Andy:	Thank you.
Andy:	Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Michael:	I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
Kevin:	No, thirty.
Michael:	Hey guys.
Erin:	No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Dwight:	It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
Michael:	I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
Roy:	Hey, man.
Dwight:	You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?

554.
Michael:	He is I.
Jim:	Nope.
Pam:	It tells me nothing.
Pam:	Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
DJ:	[at the skating rink]Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear?
Erin:	Do you want me to go back to the store?
Pam:	Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.

555.
Erin:	Do you need a hand?
Pam:	Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Elizabeth:	Hi guys!
Jim:	Yes.
Phyllis:	Is there any mustard?
Pam:	[obviously flustered] Yeah.
Jim:	Wow.
Pam:	Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.

556.
Kevin:	What do you think that was about?
Nate:	They're so elegant.
Michael:	Oh, yuck. [spits out food]
Dwight:	It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

557.
Party Waiter:	Sean.
Dwight:	[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Jim:	Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

558.
Jim:	In well?
Jim:	Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Beauty. Thank you sir!
Michael:	I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Jim:	Did you just say you remember him?
Michael:	Ahh, come on.
Dwight:	What are you saying?
Andy:	This is combo number seven.
Jim:	Thanks.

559.
Jim:	Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Pam:	[enters] Darryl! Andy!
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Jim:	Would...
Dwight:	Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Pam:	Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.

560.
Pam:	Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Kevin:	That could be a good sign.
Ryan:	It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Toby:	Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Andy:	I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Ryan Howard:	Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
Pam:	If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.

561.
Dwight:	[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Jan:	[thinks for a second] Where is it?
Jim:	Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Michael:	Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Man:	Are you sure about that?

562.
Michael:	Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Phyllis:	Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
Michael:	Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.

563.
Host:	All right, first question everyone: Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?
Charles:	Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Helene:	Michael, what are you talking about?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

564.
Toby:	Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Andy:	Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

565.
Dwight:	I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Andy:	Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
Karen:	I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
Broccoli Rob:	Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc���s of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

566.
Jan:	Good.
David:	What do you think we could be doing better?
Ryan:	Hello?
Andy:	Yes! The dude is an enigma.
Michael:	You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
Michael:	Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Doubt it. [disconnects call]
Michael:	Uh, I'll drive.

567.
Jim:	Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
Michael:	Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Michael:	No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Michael:	Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
Michael:	He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Erin:	[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Michael:	Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can't just go right to the selling, you need 'small talk.'  What topics can you use for small talk?

568.
Jim:	They���re terrible.
Michael:	A horse.
Pam:	Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
Michael:	It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.

569.
Danny:	Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Dwight:	Damn it! Jim!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
Dwight:	What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

570.
Andy:	[Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Melissa:	Daddy.
Angela:	[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

571.
Jan:	Let's just blow this party off.
Michael:	Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Andy:	Right. Okay.
Dwight:	[smiles]
Ryan:	Yes, yes, yes!

572.
Jim:	[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.
Jim:	Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Diane Kelly:	And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Michael:	I want to see it.
Michael:	Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]
Michael:	Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
Michael:	Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
Pam:	Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Jim:	[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]

573.
Girl in 2nd club:	Yeah.
Pam:	[nods and smiles]
Jim:	Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Jim:	You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Pam:	Let's just- let's go.
Angela:	There's still an hour.
Jim:	Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Intern:	How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
Jim:	Got it.
Jim:	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Jim:	Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.

574.
Michael:	MACGRUBER!
Pam:	You still want to have a party?
A.J.:	Excuse me?
Pam:	Oh, thank you.
Carol:	How?
Michael:	Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
Brian:	Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Pam:	We're really parents now.
Pam:	Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Michael:	Okay.
Michael:	Yes.

575.
Andy:	What's up, man?
Jim:	And!
Andy:	I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Dwight:	Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Jim:	I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	That's his profit.
Jim:	Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Michael:	It's not scary.

576.
Michael:	[walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Pam:	Sure.
Robert:	Why would I���..?
Michael:	That's it!
Phyllis:	But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Michael:	Really?
Michael:	Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
Carol:	Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

577.
Karen:	Yeah, all day.
AJ:	Michael. [they shake hands]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Toby:	[walks in] Hey, Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]

578.
Pam:	Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Oscar:	And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Toby:	I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
Oscar:	No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Angela:	Can you put that down there?

579.
Michael:	Toby.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Holly:	Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Dwight:	[as elevator door closes] Hold it!
Michael:	Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Dwight:	Come along, afterthought.
Michael:	This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.

580.
Jim:	So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Pam:	Salesman.
Salesman:	Let me know if I can help you with anything.
Andy:	What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Andy:	[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
Pam:	[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.

581.
Andy:	Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
Dwight:	Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Michael:	Alright, have fun.
All:	[murmuring as Dwight holds up toy forklift]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

582.
Dwight:	Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Kev!
Jan:	Pam?

583.
Ryan:	Actually, I had mine already.
Dwight:	[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Manager:	No!
Jim:	Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Dwight:	My calls?

584.
Andy:	What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
Darryl:	[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

585.
Merv:	Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Jo:	Oh, God. How far has it gone?
Michael:	I know.
Kelly:	See? I wasn't lying.
Michael:	What am I supposed to do here?
Angela:	Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Michael:	You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Kelly:	Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Me too, me too. Is this wine?

586.
Jan:	Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Meredith:	Three hundred and five.
Kevin:	Nice!
Michael:	...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Kelly:	Was he still there?
Kevin:	Don't eat it.

587.
Kelly:	I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Ryan:	Hey.
Michael:	I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
Shirley:	Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?

588.
Dwight:	No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Dwight:	Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	Are you going to happy hour later?
Angela:	We think you might kill Robert.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.

589.
Toby:	Hey, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Phyllis:	I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Michael:	You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Pam:	I don't think those were yours to take.

590.
Pam:	Yeah, I love it!
Jim:	OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Ryan:	Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Jo:	Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Warehouse Crew:	Hi, gabe.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

591.
Jan:	Back?
Stanley:	Last year, five years ago...
Jim:	No, it's not.
Michael:	Give me the phone.
Michael:	Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]
Dwight:	Eh.
Michael:	There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.

592.
Phyllis:	What?
Pam:	Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
Roy:	So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Pam:	Hmm.
Pam:	Okay.
Ex-client:	Come on guys, get out of here!
Andy:	Which one did you see?
Andy:	No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Phyllis:	What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Pam:	Sure, yeah. Yeah.
Pam:	Oh, yea!

593.
Ryan:	But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
Michael:	[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Erin:	What is that supposed to mean?
Andy:	Guess what? Not happening at work.
Jim:	No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Andy:	I should make you my vichyssoise.
Ryan:	[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Jim:	Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.

594.
David Wallace:	Yeah.
Michael:	I do okay.
Jan:	Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Hunter:	Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Dwight:	Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Michael:	Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Jan:	Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?

595.
Dwight:	Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Kelly:	Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

596.
Michael:	Plenty of space in the parking lot.
Michael:	Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Pam:	What?
Dwight:	Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Michael:	What do you race cars?
Pam:	How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Ryan:	Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Michael:	[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	We have three rooms, each with a different theme.

597.
Andy:	Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[sighs] All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Clark:	All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Also good.
Michael:	I want to see it.
Jim:	What?
Jim:	All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.

598.
Pam:	Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
Andy:	Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
Dwight:	[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Oscar:	[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Erin:	Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.

599.
Andy:	No.
Michael:	Hmm.
Deangelo:	How long have you...
Andy:	Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael and Andy:	[shouting and clapping] Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Michael:	I really appreciate it.
Andy:	You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Michael:	Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]

600.
Michael:	Spamster!
Dwight:	Dry. Delicious.
Jim:	Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Phyllis:	It's my back.
Broccoli Rob:	Will do. I love you, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Michael:	Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
Michael:	Okay.
Michael:	[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.

601.
Toby:	This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Darryl:	And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Michael:	To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

602.
Erin:	There's a dog in the car.
Michael:	How are you doing?
Pam:	[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Carol Stills:	Oh, I���m sorry Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
Jim:	[stops the watch] One second.

603.
Kelly:	[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Ryan:	Hey.
Dwight:	Sometimes it hurts Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.

604.
Andy:	All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Stanley:	Well...
Dwight:	Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Jim:	Oh, good.

605.
Michael:	Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
Darryl:	Ahem!
Michael:	Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Dwight:	No, I like Meredith.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

606.
Kelly:	This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Michael:	Push it.
Oscar:	That���s enough Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?

607.
Michael:	Da  na na na na.
Michael:	I've written all of it... in my head.
Andy:	My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Pam:	I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Toby:	Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Thanks!

608.
Angela:	A little bit.
Dwight:	Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Michael:	Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.
Michael:	No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Okay. [leaves room]

609.
Erin:	She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Pam:	The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Girl in 2nd club:	So I'll see ya soon.
Dwight:	[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

610.
Andy:	I'm in it to win.
Jim:	You know, can I call you back?
Pam:	Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	[shakes her head disapprovingly]
Supervisor:	Back to work, shoe bitch!
Jim:	Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	That's okay, I'll do it.
Pam:	No.
Andy:	Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Andy:	No.

611.
Jan:	Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Beesley, coffee?
Michael:	I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Michael:	I think I know where he is.
Kelly:	Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Jim:	Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

612.
Clark:	That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
Pete:	That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Danny:	I'm gonna go.
Angela:	You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Angela:	[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
Jim:	Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
Stu:	Grab my knee!

613.
Dana:	Ready girls? Front side.
Michael:	[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
Ryan:	Hey.
Pam:	Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.

614.
Jim:	Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Erin:	Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Karen:	You sure?
Mrs. Wallace:	Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything.

615.
Jim:	Hey.
Jim:	Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Kelly:	Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Ryan:	Hey.
Michael:	Okay, we're done! That's it.
Jo:	You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Jim:	Oh. Oh!
Jim:	Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Michael:	Could I talk to you for a second?
Jim:	He just sent a text...
Michael:	No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Jo:	I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?

616.
Hannah:	Yeah, I mean my stuff's coming over, but umm... is this...is this yours? [holds up travel mug]
Kevin:	I insult you, Oscar.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?

617.
Jim:	What did I write?
Michael:	Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Stanley:	Well...
Dwight:	My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
Dwight:	Salad.
Julie:	Good. Hi.
Michael:	What?

618.
Jim:	Mm-hmm.
Dwight:	....back orders and you never called them.
Angela:	You won't see-
Andy:	Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
Michael:	I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	This is how business...
Pam:	That's a communal bowl.
Andy:	Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Pam:	Sorta, yes.

619.
Kevin:	[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Office:	Aw, Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

620.
Creed:	Your shower radio.
Oscar:	Oh, that's very funny.
Darryl:	I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Holly:	Yeah.
Holly:	I'm going out with you.
Jim:	[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.

621.
Jim:	[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
Someone:	So your trip to Scottsdale was good?
Mark:	Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! [laughs] Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
Kids:	Ewwww!
Erin:	[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	I don't know if I wanna do this.

622.
Pam:	Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Michael:	Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Nellie:	I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Pam:	I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Michael:	Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Michael:	God, this is gonna be fun.
Jim:	Oh, thanks man.

623.
Michael:	Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
Deangelo:	Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Michael:	Because I would kick his ass.
Erin:	It was a little much Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

624.
Dwight:	Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Kevin:	Thank you.
Pam:	[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Erin:	[at vending machine] B-9.
Dwight:	Kelly is disqualified!
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	Okay. So yeah.

625.
Michael:	Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
Michael:	That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
Holly:	[laughs] I can't wait.
Michael:	It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
Michael:	Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Hotel Manager:	It became a safety issue, sir.
Luke:	No!
Michael:	Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.

626.
Dwight:	I could never do that!
Gabor:	Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi���s. A lot of telemarketing.
Jim:	Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Oscar:	What's the joke?
Pam:	That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.

627.
Ryan:	It's an investment.
Oscar:	Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jo:	If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
Jim:	You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Jim:	Because you've solved zero cases.

628.
Angela:	Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Michael:	So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	You want to grab her?

629.
Ryan:	Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
Dwight:	Let me out.
Dwight:	And flexible.
Holly:	Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.

630.
Erin:	[whispers] It's the fuzz!
Michael:	Do you want the raise or what?
Michael:	[phone rings, hits speaker button]
speaker:	line_text
Michael:	Look, my clothes are so wet!
Toby:	What's going on?
Oscar:	You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?

631.
Video Michael:	Shut that off!
Stanley:	Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Kevin:	No way!
Stanley:	I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Kevin:	You could put a banana in it.
Kevin:	You said she liked me.
Kevin:	Are you kidding me?

632.
Dwight:	[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Yeah!
Andy:	Don���t care. Tell me later.
Michael:	[off camera] That's terrible.

633.
Jim:	Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Pam:	Mike Tibbets, really?
Darryl:	Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Dwight:	Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	I could give you some beginner stickies?
Jim:	Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
Dwight:	Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.

634.
Jim:	[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Dwight:	Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	No.
Pam:	Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!

635.
Jim:	Nope.
Casey:	[singing] Casey Dean!
Casey Dean:	You can���t just sit here and cry.
Andy:	Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jim:	Just... quit stalling.
Jim:	Yeah?
Andy:	Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	[claps] That was fantastic.

636.
Dwight:	Good. Good. And...
Christian:	You were really brave!  You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.
Michael:	[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
Michael:	Erin... what are you doing?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Pam:	Love you.
Dwight:	You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Pam:	Hmm, that is... Janet Fenstermaker.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Electricity.
Pam:	Hey!

637.
A.J.:	A.J.
Michael:	Yeah, Drew.
Pam:	We said some. We said ���some.���
Michael:	[enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.

638.
Michael:	Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Pam:	[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
Jim:	Sales.
Jim:	Shh.
Michael:	Why?
Jim:	It's the lever on the side.
Teddy:	Suck it!
Kevin:	[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Michael:	Exactly!
Pam:	Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.

639.
Kevin:	[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Someone:	So your trip to Scottsdale was good?
Jim:	Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Michael:	Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

640.
Michael:	500
Michael:	Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Jim:	But what are you gonna do about that?
Michael:	[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]
Kelly:	Oh, art show!
Phyllis:	That's the character's name?
Jim:	Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Dwight:	It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Kelly:	Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Jim:	Yes.
Phyllis:	Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Bob:	Yes!

641.
Kevin:	Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Here we go.
Stanley:	Yes...

642.
Andy:	Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Carla Fern:	Are you in that paper documentary too?
Jim:	But there is a reason why I'm here!
Jan:	Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Pam:	Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
Jan:	Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
Andy:	How could I not see it?  You're so right.
Jim:	No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Andy:	Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

643.
Kevin:	You aren't curious?
Creed:	It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
Ed:	Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Andy:	You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
Andy:	We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
Sweeney Todd:	You found Johanna.
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Andy:	Did you mean a real date?
Andy:	You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-

644.
Holly:	Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Andy:	Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Phyllis:	Not according to the beans.
Michael:	Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

645.
Jim:	Yeah.
Jim:	Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
Phyllis:	She's out of your league Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Robert:	[on the computer screen] I���ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Ryan:	Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Ryan:	And?
Ryan:	[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.

646.
Michael:	OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
Michael:	Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]
Creed:	Huh?

647.
Dwight:	Yeah.
Meredith:	Hey!
Phyllis:	Oh, we find little times during the day.
Michael:	Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
Pam:	I lied about some aspects of the building.
Dwight:	Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Phyllis:	Yeah, what's the reason?
Dwight:	[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?

648.
Michael:	OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
Michael:	Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Erin:	Let's go.
Pam:	Well, something's off.
Jo:	And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Michael:	I'm not wearing a wire, so...
Nellie:	I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Michael:	And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

649.
Jim:	Peepa.
Jim:	Congratulations!
Pam:	How's it going?
Angela:	Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	We're all going bowling!

650.
Angela:	Hey!
Dwight:	All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
Dwight:	What's with the smile?
Jim:	Can you give us a hint?
Priest:	You may now kiss the bride.
Jim:	You can write a book about chairs.
Jim:	Mm-hmm.
Jim:	okay.
Jim:	So, that's how it's gonna be.
Dwight:	[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.

651.
Jan:	I just think that...
Jim:	That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Michael:	What?
Michael:	I don't think you froze.
Toby:	Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
Officer 2:	The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Michael:	Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.

652.
Pam:	It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Rachel:	Hello Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
David:	Good. [Michael leaves office]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	No, I'm not even wearing that much.
Michael:	I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Michael:	I'm goin 'in!
Michael:	Testify.
Michael:	No, we can't.

653.
Pam:	I don't think those were yours to take.
Darryl:	You're not staying?
Michael:	Could I stick it with a pin?
Phyllis:	Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Andy:	No way!?
Pam:	Great.
Pam:	Sure, do you have a camera here?
Michael:	Thanks Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

654.
Pete:	It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Michael:	[on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	She looks older.
Dwight:	Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Michael:	Play some games?
Michael:	Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Michael:	I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.

655.
Jim:	[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Michael:	Okay.
Michael:	Is it?
Michael:	Who else?
Pam:	Hey!
Michael:	And many more!

656.
Andy:	What happened? What can I do to help?
Robert:	Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	Fine.
Michael:	Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
Pam:	Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Pam:	Love you, mom.
Michael:	I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?

657.
Michael:	No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Jim:	Nice. Smart.
Jim:	There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	Yes boss.
Jim:	All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

658.
Andy:	Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Roy:	Yeah!
Andy:	We're gonna do it outside.
Jim:	[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
Pam:	Hey Hank.

659.
Michael:	I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
Kevin:	I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Jim:	Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Holly:	Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Phyllis:	I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

660.
Dwight:	Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
Phyllis:	And it didn't change your mind.
Erin:	Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Jim:	Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Andy:	Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Jim:	Thanks.

661.
Dwight:	I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Darryl:	You done?
Dwight:	Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

662.
Phyllis:	What are these for?
Kelly:	Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Clark:	Stimulate it.
Realtor:	[on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
Dwight:	Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

663.
Darryl:	Looks that way.
Toby:	Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Erin:	Of course.
Toby:	[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Darryl:	Life hacking, man.
Creed:	You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

664.
Michael:	Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	And have a good elevator ride.

665.
Stanley:	Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	You haven't told me.
Dwight:	How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Michael:	But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
Michael:	[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

666.
Jim:	Oh, sorry, wait one second.
Roy:	So how's your day going?
Andy:	Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Andy:	I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Andy:	Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Kelly:	I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.

667.
Kevin:	Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Dwight:	How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Tom:	Hey, future baby sis!
Michael:	I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
Michael:	Yes, thank you.
Jan:	[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Dwight:	I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.

668.
Michael:	Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Kevin:	Yeah!
Andy:	Go, go, go, go!
Michael:	Well, it has certain connotations.

669.
Michael:	Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Everyone:	[cheering]
Jim:	At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Oscar:	I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Michael:	Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Kelly:	I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Deangelo:	I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.

670.
Phyllis:	[out of breath] Bowling.
Ryan:	Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
Jim:	How are you?
Ryan:	Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Have we heard of it?
Andy:	Me likey!

671.
Toby:	You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	I was telling that... I was telling that.
Kevin:	Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Jim:	So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Andy:	My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
Andy:	Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.

672.
Kelly:	Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Ryan:	Hey.
Dwight:	It doesn't make any sense.
Michael:	Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.
Toby:	Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
Michael:	I'm trying!
Dwight:	Try Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

673.
Dwight:	I don't understand the reference.
Jim:	Nope. Baskets have it.
Andy:	From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Abby:	Alright.
Michael:	Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Dwight:	[sighs] Please? Please?
Michael:	Hi, Jan!

674.
Michael:	Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
Erin:	Witch���s brew?
Michael:	You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
Pam:	What?
Dwight:	Ow.
Jim:	[to Pam] A banana?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Michael:	I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
Jim:	Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.

675.
Pam:	That���s regular pizza.
Pam:	I don't know, but it's interesting right?
Dwight:	We're gonna bust this guy.
Jim:	Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]

676.
Robert:	[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don���t scare you?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Michael:	[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Yes, I was quilled.
Michael:	Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...

677.
Jim:	Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Michael:	Okay.
Jim:	The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
speaker:	line_text
Darryl:	We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Dwight:	[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	[unimpressed] Really?
Darryl:	They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Jim:	Yep...
Dwight:	Not so weak, huh, Mom?

678.
Dwight:	I am a person.
Angela:	We'll see.
Jim:	Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Dwight:	Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Jim:	Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Pam:	Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
Gabe:	Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

679.
Andy:	I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
Ryan:	Good luck Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
Jo:	Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.
Jim:	Okay. Roy.
Roy:	Hey, man.
Jim:	I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

680.
Dwight:	Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
Michael:	What?
Jim:	Still want that.
Jim:	I thought we had that looked at.
Erin:	You tricked me!
Dwight:	So sexy it becomes hostile.
Jim:	Captain Crunch.
Jim:	Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Kelly:	Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	In which direction?

681.
Dwight:	You���re being disrespectful!
Jan:	[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Phyllis:	[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	OK, it stopped.
Pizza guy:	What?
Dwight:	Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Michael:	Yes, I...
Michael:	No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.

682.
Michael:	I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Michael:	Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!
Kid:	I'm a bumble bee.
Michael:	Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
Pam:	Oh, great! That sounds good!

683.
Jan:	Yeah?
Dwight:	That's Andy Bernard.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Billy's Girlfriend:	I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Dwight:	One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Dwight:	Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
Kelly:	I don't get the reason for this party.
Dwight:	Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Jan:	Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...

684.
Toby:	Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
Ryan:	No you don't.
Michael:	Here we go, let's sit down.
Pam:	Yeah. Coward.
Dana:	Great.
Michael:	Where you going?
Michael:	What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Pam:	You know it���s just herbal tea.
Toby:	I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

685.
Dwight:	She sent an email, so.
Dwight:	Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
Jim:	Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	I am gay, and I prefer men.
Michael:	Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
Dwight:	The temp.

686.
Jan:	Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Hunter:	Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Ryan:	Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
Dwight:	Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
Angela:	[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
Dwight:	[laughs] Nice.
Dwight:	Oh, god, this again? You���re Stinky.
Dwight:	Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Dwight:	Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Hunter:	Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

687.
Michael:	Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...
Gabe:	Yep! Waste not right?
Pam:	That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Kevin:	You love your mom.
Michael:	Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.

688.
Kevin:	[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Jim:	Caleb!
Michael:	Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Kevin:	How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?

689.
Dwight:	Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
Jim:	Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Michael:	No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jo:	Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.

690.
Dwight:	Undistributable.
Erin:	I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Michael:	Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Brian:	Seeya.
Dwight:	Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.

691.
Katy:	Oh, um, it's okay.
Michael:	Stop the bus, okay?
Jim:	No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Jim:	He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Ryan:	David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?

692.
Michael:	[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Jim:	What does that mean?
Michael:	Woooah! Wow!
Michael:	Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?

693.
Jim:	No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Michael:	What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	Woohoo!

694.
Dwight:	Let's get this roof going.
Michael:	Yes, what else?
Phyllis:	Okay.
Creed:	[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

695.
Michael:	Yes.
Toby:	How?
Michael:	Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam:	Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Jo:	No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
Michael:	Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
Oscar:	We knew. Ryan told us.

696.
Michael:	Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Michael:	Are you making a--
Jim:	[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
Andy:	Don���t care. Tell me later.
Meredith:	Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.

697.
Dwight:	So who are we laughing at?
Michael:	Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	I did, my wife's name is Terri.
Jim:	Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Ryan:	Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Dwight:	Why are you looking at my forehead?
Ryan:	We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Michael:	[singing] You down with the Dundies?

698.
Kevin:	Many small time make big time.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Jan:	Uh, how are you?
Erin:	[whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	I don���t know where it came from.
Jan:	Good luck, Brenda.
Brenda:	Yeah. Everybody's really nice.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Andy:	Erin likes Gabe.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.

699.
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.
Erin:	Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Michael:	I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Phyllis:	It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Stanley:	Well...
Stanley:	Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Michael:	Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	What?
Jim:	Uh-

700.
Michael:	Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
Dwight:	You���re being disrespectful!
Dwight:	Hey, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jan:	I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Host:	Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?
Jim:	Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Jim:	Thanks Janet.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Dwight:	...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
Dwight:	Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.

701.
Dwight:	Told you.
Dwight:	Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	There, there...
Pam:	Mmm.
Blood Drive Worker:	I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information. [Michael sighs]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Dwight Schrute for Robert California!

702.
Dwight:	Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Andy:	Why did we pretend like we work here?
Michael:	You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Michael:	This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
Dwight:	Oh! [collapses]
Creed:	No.
Andy:	We're taking a picture.
Dwight:	Yes, of course it does.
Dwight:	C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]

703.
Michael:	Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
Pam:	Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Robert:	No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
Andy:	Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[interrupting] Okay okay okay.
Michael:	You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.

704.
Dwight:	What's jazz hands?
Pam:	Okay. [punches Toby's hand]
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Dwight:	Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Dwight:	No trades.
Dwight:	Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
Rolf:	No. You���re interviewing for it. I���m getting it.
Michael:	Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.

705.
Kevin:	Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Dwight:	American Idol? What? No.
Michael:	Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

706.
Pete:	Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
Kevin:	Pete...
Pete:	That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Yes.
Jim:	Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Uh, better ask Jim.

707.
Jan:	You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Jan:	Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.
Karen:	Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

708.
Michael:	[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.
Kelly:	Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Jim:	Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Michael:	A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	[talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
Darryl:	And the game's over seconds later.

709.
Michael:	Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Michael:	Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Dwight:	You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.

710.
Michael:	Keep simulating.
Michael:	Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Kelly:	Not so much anymore.
Pam:	Ah!

711.
Andy:	Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Yeah.
Toby:	Course you do.
Pam:	Let's just- let's go.
Toby:	Yeah. Yeah, I don���t think���
Michael:	She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
Pam:	Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Michael:	Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.

712.
Erin:	Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Susan:	Hello. Oh call me Susan please.
Jim:	And I don't support her choice to hit you.
Jim:	That's not a good idea.
Jim:	Hey! Back here.
Meredith:	[still laughing] I know.
Andy:	Alright, a plan it is.

713.
Andy & Erin:	[singing] Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the 'Electric City' sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab - [guitar stops]
Jim:	Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Michael:	That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
Andy:	Are you volunteering?
Andy:	OF course not.  There���s no magic button.  You have to summon that.

714.
Dwight:	How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan:	Hello.
Pam:	[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Kelly:	You told us we had to.

715.
Michael:	No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
Michael:	Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Holly:	I can't wait.
Co-Worker 3:	We'd love for you to come, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Holly:	Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Pam:	Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

716.
Karen:	Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Dwight:	I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Robert:	Hi.
Andy:	[in robot voice] What is going on?
Ryan:	Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	How long has he been in the bathroom?
Dwight:	What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Andy:	Are you sure?
Andy:	You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.

717.
Jim:	Oh, sure.
Robert:	When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?
Dwight:	[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
Dwight:	Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
Michael:	Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
Office:	Aw, Michael!
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Dwight:	Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.

718.
Andy:	Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Dwight:	Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Phyllis:	Thanks Angela.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Dwight:	Sure

719.
Erin:	Yeah.
Creed:	Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.

720.
Andy:	If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Deangelo:	Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
Dwight:	Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
Michael:	Any good headhunter knows I am available.

721.
Michael:	Yes.
Angela:	No, it doesn't!
Michael:	What does what mean?
Pam:	Exactly.
Oscar:	They caught us kissing on Halloween.

722.
Darryl:	That's regular text talk.
Pam:	It's better, thanks.
Pete:	Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
Michael:	Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Pam:	No.
Michael:	Hey, have you seen Jim?

723.
Dwight:	Yes.
Pam:	[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Phyllis:	What do we do? How do we stop this?
Andy:	No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.
Jim:	Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Andy:	A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Dwight:	Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
Dwight:	The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.

724.
Michael:	I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Donna:	Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kelly:	Hi, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Wow.
Michael:	You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!

725.
Jim:	Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Angela:	Alright, let's go, let's go.
Robert:	Yeah.
Dwight:	No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Creed:	Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
Jim:	Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.

726.
Michael:	[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Creed:	Let���s find out what I did.
Jim:	Oh, yeah.
Michael:	Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	We were robbed last night.
Jim:	Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Cece:	[crying]
Pam:	Cause they're just stupid.

727.
Ryan:	Yep.
Andy:	This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Pam:	I move we sell!
Toby:	Well, you know, 'cause of  the trains.
Pam:	[looking confused] You did that?
Pam:	I'm more of a dog person.
Ryan:	All the time.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'

728.
David:	Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Hey.
Dwight:	Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Kevin:	Tuna Tuna Tuna.

729.
Dwight:	Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	Line 2.
Jim:	In well?
Kevin:	[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth]
Darryl:	[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Jim:	Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	I got a knock-knock joke.

730.
Kelly:	Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Pam:	When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
Michael:	All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Everything is going to be ok.

731.
Michael:	[Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Dwight:	I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
Employee:	I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.
Pam:	Song parody writer.
Song:	Everybody hurts,

732.
Bob:	1,000
Jim:	It has been, yeah.
Michael:	Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	It's too little. Use the phone.

733.
Kevin:	Yeah.
Pam:	Your shirt is buttoned wrong.
Michael:	Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Michael:	Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?

734.
Michael:	Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Michael:	Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
Karen:	Toby's not a salesperson.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Meredith:	Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
Andy:	I don't normally do this, but...
Michael:	Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.

735.
Andy:	Was that hot or what?
Oscar:	Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Michael:	[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Michael:	Pass.
Michael:	Huh?
Jim:	What are we doing?
Pam:	I am Dr. Cinderella.
Michael:	You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Pam:	Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
Michael:	I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
Pam:	[listening in New York] I miss him.

736.
Michael:	I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[thoughtfully] A statue.
Jan:	We'd been fighting for a while-
Michael:	Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
Karen:	Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Right.
Michael:	Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Jim:	Uh--
Jim:	Nobody asked, Bob!
Bob:	Yes!

737.
Nellie:	I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Dwight:	And anoth���
Pam:	How'd the run go?
Jordan:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Let me out or you're fired.
Pam:	Hey.
Andy:	Well, you got it this year too.
Dwight:	It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
Dwight:	Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?

738.
Michael:	Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.
Darryl:	Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Andy:	Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
Andy:	Where are we in the process?
Darryl:	OK, great.
Andy:	Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Secretary:	He's in a meeting.
Michael:	Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Carol:	Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

739.
Michael:	Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

740.
Toby:	It wasn't a vote. You decided.
Dwight:	By hand.
Andy:	Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
Jim:	OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Be respectful, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

741.
Michael:	I need him gone.
Michael:	Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
Angela:	And I made cookies. Same category.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Kevin:	After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.

742.
Michael:	It's seems like ya did though-
Darryl:	[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
Bruce:	Made it.
Michael:	Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.
Ryan Howard:	Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
Michael:	[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.

743.
Darryl:	Good luck with that.
Andy:	Dwight's grandfather was a���[is interrupted by Dwight].
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim:	Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Dwight:	Yeah, we���ll see about that.
Dwight:	Yes.

744.
Angela:	Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Pam:	Step away.
Kevin:	Pam, look out!
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Michael:	I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
Dwight:	If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Pam:	We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Michael:	I just saw this baby daddy-

745.
Clark:	Yes, congratulations.
Jim:	Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
Andy:	You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Michael:	Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Jim:	So, not prison.

746.
Kevin:	Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?
Cathy:	It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Jim:	Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Michael:	Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
Jim:	Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.

747.
Bar Manager:	Get out. Now.
Erin:	I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Jim:	Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Jim:	Okay.
Andy:	[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
Jim:	[shakes head]
Erin:	I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Andy:	I got it, try, um--[Coughs]

748.
Andy:	AHHHHH!!!!!!!
Kevin:	Well, Hol, this is it.
Phyllis:	I think you look nice.
Angela:	I'm so glad you could come.
Nellie:	Oh yes.
Andy:	I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Kevin:	Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Kevin:	[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Andy:	All right!
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.

749.
Michael:	I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
Danny:	Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Toby:	I--I could--I could talk about it.
Michael:	You're what, like, 12?
Jim:	No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Michael:	I'm going with Pam's group.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	So I'm not in trouble?
Michael:	Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.

750.
Dwight:	That was... unauthorized.
Kelly:	Ask where he's from.
Dwight:	Yeah!
Erin:	Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Michael:	Um, my CDs.
Angela:	Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight

751.
Michael:	Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Ryan:	[to Dwight] Don't...
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	Dunder-Mifflin.
Jim:	Can you grow up?
Jim:	That's not okay.
Helene:	I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Michael:	I heard a-
Michael:	That is how you do it.

752.
Angela:	[gasps]
Andy:	[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Dwight:	What are you writing about me?
Michael:	[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!

753.
Bob:	300
Dwight:	What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Michael:	Yeah.
Stanley:	We deserve to know.

754.
Nellie:	Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Don't...
Nick:	We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
Angela:	Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Pam:	I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Michael:	[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
Andy:	[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Michael:	No.
Michael:	Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
Pam:	And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.

755.
Jim:	If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Andy:	I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
Rolf:	Thank you, Dwight. I���ll be in touch.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Intern:	How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
Andy:	No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
Andy:	Hey!
Jim:	I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

756.
Michael:	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Jo:	Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.
Michael:	No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
Jim:	Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.

757.
Ryan:	I told you not to call about small problems.
Jim:	And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Michael:	Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]

758.
Andy:	No.
Pam:	There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Jim:	It's not on your desk.
Pam:	Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Ryan:	Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Kelly:	Hope she's OK.
Andy:	Obviously I'm going to clean up.

759.
Andy:	Did you see who did it?
Karen:	That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Stanley:	How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
Jim:	An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?

760.
Darryl:	What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Stanley:	Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	[enters abruptly] Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
Pam:	[shakes head]
Pam:	Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.

761.
Stanley:	Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Darryl:	What's something you really care about?
Jim:	So, next interview has to be better.

762.
Deangelo:	Yeah, I don't know.
Dwight:	Not all the time.
Michael:	Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Ryan:	Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	What?
Dwight:	No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Michael:	No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!

763.
Dwight:	What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Michael:	Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Jim:	Ok.
Jim:	Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Kevin:	No me fault.
Meredith:	Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	...uh, no.
Michael:	Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Dwight:	Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?

764.
Jim:	Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Nail stylist 2:	[to Clark] You take off your glasses.
Clark:	Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
Pam:	Did it help?
Dwight:	It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
Jim:	Good one.

765.
Holly:	Hi.
Kelly:	So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Brandon:	At midnight?
Dwight:	My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
Dwight:	Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
Oscar:	I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Oscar:	I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Rep:	First would you mind verifying your home address?
Dwight:	Who is this?

766.
Kevin:	Oscar. Angela.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Erin:	We've already rescheduled seven times.
Phyllis:	I think he left.
Dwight:	No way.
Dwight:	Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?

767.
Nellie:	Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
Kevin:	Will you take a check?
Michael:	Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Mark:	Hey, you must be Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
Dwight:	Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Michael:	Phyllis?  Could you take-.

768.
Pam:	Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Jim:	Whoa whoa whoa!
Dwight:	Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Phyllis:	Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jan:	Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

769.
Jim:	No big deal.
Michael:	Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	OK!
Michael:	That's not true.

770.
Pam:	[smiles]
Jim:	All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Erin:	That's crazy.
Jim:	No. I would've said no.
Andy:	You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Jim:	Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Pam:	Hello! This is... the client.
Jim:	Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.

771.
Dwight:	Cool, let's start with the banisters.
Michael:	Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
Michael:	Alright.
Angela:	No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Michael:	[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?

772.
Kevin:	Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
Eric:	No, waste of time and resources.
Jim:	Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

773.
Michael:	What?
Dwight:	Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Stanley:	Well...
Kevin:	Why don't you go Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Thank you!  Wish me luck!
Michael:	Pass.
Dwight:	He's heading downtown.
Michael:	Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Kevin:	Thank you.
Dwight:	[to Packer] Silence.

774.
Pam:	[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Cece:	[crying]
Michael:	So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
Clark:	I absolutely will do that.
Kevin:	Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

775.
Jim:	Yeah.  Sure.
Clark:	I am.
Darryl:	Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
Michael:	Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
Jim:	Well you gotta figure this out.
Jim:	Two minutes...
Michael:	No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
Michael:	Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.

776.
Michael:	Really?  Would you do that?
Pam:	Hey.
Michael:	[whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]
Stanley:	Well...

777.
Charles:	Jim. Pam.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Erin:	Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Dwight:	No. Jim, come on.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	[as others eat] Wait!
Jim:	Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
Pam:	Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Dwight:	Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Jim:	Take it easy.

778.
Michael:	We did?
Stanley:	[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
Creed:	It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Nana:	So let's hear it.
Pam:	She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
Michael:	You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Pam:	Not at all.
Michael:	What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Michael:	You excited? About the new company?
Pam:	Just let me have... Oh.

779.
Angela:	No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Dwight:	Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Michael:	The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Michael:	I went through Holly's things.
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
David:	Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
Dwight:	Come on pretty boy.
Michael:	You're right. What do you mean though?

780.
Dwight:	You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	I, uh, hmm.
Pam:	What did Jan want?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Dwight:	Sex.

781.
Michael:	And then another--
Jim:	Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Toby:	Fine. Good.
Michael:	Yes.
Darryl:	I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Andy:	Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
Michael:	Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
Darryl:	What?
Michael:	Yeah, he is that good-looking.
Darryl:	Yep. Take care.
Michael:	I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Michael:	Shake it, shake it!

782.
Michael:	I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.
Ryan:	Hey.
Jim:	What do we got?
Jim:	Oh, no, no. No.
Dwight:	Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Stanley:	Well...

783.
Song:	Everybody cries
Everybody:	Surprise!
Michael:	Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
Dwight:	Ahh! OK!
Nellie:	Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful

784.
Dwight:	Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Jessica:	You're breaking up with me?
Ryan:	Actually Ryan.
Andy:	[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Thank you, accounting department.
Dwight:	...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Jessica:	Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Dwight:	[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Jim:	Pull up your pants.
Andy:	Actor?

785.
Jim:	Oh, yeah.
Michael:	Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]
Meredith:	I am so pissed at this company!
Dwight:	Drop this one. Abort.
Michael:	Problem. Good.

786.
Andy:	Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
Jim:	[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Meredith:	Wow!

787.
Kevin:	No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Michael:	I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
Jim:	Yeah, totally you did.
Darryl:	I hate myself.
Pam:	What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.

788.
Karen:	Hey dummy, get in the car!
Michael:	I'm just walking around.
Michael:	Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
Ryan:	Cool.
Pam:	Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.

789.
Michael:	Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?
Michael:	[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Jim:	Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Stanley:	How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Michael:	Yes, it is.
Michael:	In business school, Kevin. Business school.

790.
Dwight:	You don't work with us.
Michael:	Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
Dwight:	Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Ryan:	I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Oscar:	Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Ryan:	I'm already in business school.

791.
Kevin:	That is lame.
Dwight:	What?
Dwight:	Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Ryan:	Hey.
Ryan:	No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Dwight:	Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Robert:	She likes you.
Kevin:	Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.

792.
Michael:	I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
Meredith:	I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
Andy:	Awkward.
Jan:	Are you listening to me Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

793.
Dwight:	I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Dwight:	Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Kelly:	Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael:	Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.

794.
Stanley:	I am going back to my desk...
Jim:	Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Pam:	Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

795.
Michael:	Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Pam:	Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

796.
Jim:	I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Jamie:	Yeah. I only have a minute.
Angela:	Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Toby:	I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Why?
Michael:	Good.
Michael:	All right, we need something for Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Angela:	Mm-hmm.

797.
Jim:	Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Angela:	[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim:	So, none of them?
Andy:	Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Toby:	Hey.
Dwight:	Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Esther:	Hi Dwight.

798.
Oscar:	Well...
Jim:	Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
Bob:	Yes!
Michael:	I thought you had to pee.
Michael:	It was a good idea, though.
Nellie:	Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Everyone:	OH!
Jim:	Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Cece:	[crying]
Jim:	Hi.
Michael:	[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.
Michael:	What?

799.
Jim:	Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Jan:	Excuse me?
Darryl:	Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Jim:	Umm, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

800.
Kevin:	You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
Darryl:	Mm, it's not that big.

801.
Darryl:	Cheeseburger or hamburger.
Darryl:	Oh, ok.
Michael:	We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
Michael:	Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
Everyone:	OH!
Ryan:	Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Ryan:	The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
Val:	Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.

802.
Michael:	You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
Bob:	Yes!
Michael:	What?
Pam:	Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Andy:	Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Pam:	Talk to you later?
Pam:	Oh yeah. That's too bad.

803.
Michael:	[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Andy:	You do?
Creed:	It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Ryan:	Hey.
Michael:	Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
Michael:	Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Andy:	Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	Okey doke.

804.
Darryl:	I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Dwight:	There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Darryl:	And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Dwight:	Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

805.
Jim:	Really?
Jim:	[baby voice] Hi.
Michael:	What's the matter... haaaww!
Angela:	Ugh.
Michael:	I had to do that.
Phyllis:	Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Michael:	Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	It doesn't matter what I know.

806.
Jim:	We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Erin:	I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Andy:	Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
Laurie:	Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.
Ryan:	I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Andy:	I have a delicious secret.
Erin:	And here's the fax for you.
Ryan:	Unreal.
Andy:	Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]

807.
Meredith:	I like her fingernails.
Michael:	[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Kevin:	Kevin.
Andy:	Hey Darryl.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Michael:	I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.
Zion:	I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother.
Mikela:	Mr. Scott?
Michael:	[runs down to parking lot, sighs]

808.
Michael:	Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Stu:	Grab my knee!
Roy:	No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Kevin:	Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Jan:	Oh, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...

809.
Pam:	Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Pam:	Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
Pam:	I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Oscar:	[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
Dwight:	As Assistant Regional Manager...
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Pam:	Win!
Dwight:	Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...

810.
Michael:	Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Luke:	Hey, [bleep] this! Screw it!
Michael:	Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
Michael:	Mm-hmm.
Toby:	Hmmm.

811.
Michael:	I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Robert:	Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?
Dwight:	Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Holly:	We don't know that.
Michael:	God, does anybody read the paper?!

812.
Jim:	No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Pam:	Hey, Kenny.
Kenny:	Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?
Ryan:	Hey, you.

813.
Jessica:	It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Michael:	Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
Michael:	Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dwight:	I do!
Pam:	Tell me I'm good at sales.
Danny:	I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Dwight:	OK, everybody just calm down.
Dwight:	Saturday.

814.
Dwight:	[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Carol:	Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.
Jim:	[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
Erin:	We have our decision.
Jim:	You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Michael:	It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.

815.
Michael:	...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Creed:	Huh?
Dwight:	Ok, ok.
Angela:	[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

816.
Jim:	OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Dwight:	I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Jo:	Michael?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

817.
Kelly:	I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Everyone:	Goodbye! Good luck! [empty bottle falls to the ground]
Jim:	There it is.
Jim:	Bye.

818.
Jim:	Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Jan:	...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Michael:	[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
Ryan:	Hey.

819.
Jim:	Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
Angela:	[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Holly's Dad:	What are you doing there?
Michael:	Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

820.
Dwight:	Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Michael:	I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
Pam:	Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
Stanley:	Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Jim:	Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Jim:	You must be really proud.
Michael:	[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Michael:	Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Jim:	Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Jim:	Oh... Good.

821.
Oscar:	Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Andy:	Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
Susan:	Hello. Oh call me Susan please.
Michael:	Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
Craig:	Hey.

822.
Andy:	So?
Darryl:	Loyalty.
Andy:	Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
Meredith:	I have a lot of work to do.
Kevin:	Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
Michael:	I know, I know.
Michael:	Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
Kevin:	[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
Michael:	Hmm.

823.
Katy:	I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Andy:	A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
Jim:	Alright. Great. Thank you.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	Ready?
Jim:	That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. O'Malley:	I love lawyer jokes.
Michael:	How about some Splenda?
Michael:	I don't know.
Michael:	Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!

824.
Holly:	[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.

825.
Michael:	This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
Ryan:	Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Dan:	And that about does it, thank you.
Michael:	[In Horshack voice from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
Ryan:	Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Susan:	Why would you not want me working here?
Kevin:	[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Michael:	Dwight. Hey!
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Yes.
Michael:	I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...

826.
Michael:	700
Stanley:	Me too. [holds up four fingers]
Dwight:	Goodbye.
Stanley:	What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Andy:	[drinks hand soap]
Oscar:	This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]

827.
Kelly:	Hi, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	God!

828.
Dwight:	I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
Nellie:	Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Andy:	Who are your role models?
Andy:	WHAT?
Michael:	Irrelevant.
Packer:	Sit on the throne, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Okay.

829.
Michael:	Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Toby:	[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
Sasha:	Do you need any help?
Kevin:	Because of reasons...
Sherri:	Mm-Hmm.

830.
Andy:	[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
Kelly:	If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Michael:	Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Everybody:	Surprise!
Kevin:	One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Andy:	Oh, doggie.
Michael:	Oh... ah, I almost choked.
Michael:	It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
Kevin:	Wait, what?

831.
Angela:	So what are your credentials?
Jim:	Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Smiles.
Jim:	Is that trash talk from Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

832.
Pete:	Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Andy:	No, that's...
Pam:	Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Roy:	Natural redhead.
Michael:	Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
Michael:	Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!

833.
Kevin:	Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Dwight:	Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Dwight:	Ok, ok.
Jim:	[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Pam:	[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Jim:	OK...
Dwight:	I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]

834.
Pam:	At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
Toby:	That may have been my fault.
Ryan:	One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Packer:	Did you say 'masturbator?'
Pam:	Hello.

835.
Andy:	It just was one of those things-
Nellie:	Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.
Jim:	Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim:	That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.

836.
Darryl:	Hey Michael. This ain't over.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Oh. [smiling]

837.
Michael:	Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.
Michael:	Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Andy:	Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Ryan:	Yeah... Mmmmm...
Dwight:	[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Ryan:	All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

838.
Michael:	Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Kevin:	God, I hate it.
Michael:	Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili's Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Dwight:	Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Michael:	No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
Michael:	Okay.

839.
Michael:	No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
Charles:	Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Waiter:	[pointing to each correct person] Ryan, Pam, Stanley, Kelly, Kevin, Creed. How'd I do?
Stanley:	Well...
Lefevre:	You can pay for my college.
Michael:	Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Michael:	Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
Michael:	I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.

840.
Toby:	No not really...
Michael:	Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!

841.
Jim:	Yeah. Even you.
Jim:	Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Dwight:	You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Jim:	You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Michael:	Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.

842.
Esther:	Oh! I���m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
Kevin:	Yes.
Oscar:	My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Jim:	Nobody asked, Bob!
Bob:	Yes!
Jim:	That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
Jim:	Thanks.

843.
Erin:	See? We can all be friends!
Gabe:	That is not how it seems to me.
Andy:	No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
Oscar:	Hey Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Oscar:	This is why I'm here?
Jim:	Great. Let me just...
Jim:	I don't know about, love...

844.
Toby:	Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
Angela:	I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
Dwight:	Well, I did it too.
Gabe:	I'll just turn the captions on.
Kelly:	Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Michael. Stop.

845.
Jan:	Hello, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Phyllis:	Mm.
Dwight:	[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Get up off your desks!
Michael:	Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
Stanley:	Well...
Jim:	Look at that form.

846.
Kelly:	Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Erin:	Oy. Andy, what���s going on?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Dwight:	Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
Michael:	Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.

847.
Darryl:	OK.
Photographer:	Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Yes?
Jan:	You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jan:	The board voted last night to close your branch.

848.
Michael:	Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
Man:	Hey! It���s Andy Bernard!
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Angela:	Uh-huh.
Micahel:	Okay, all right. You know what?
Michael:	You know what we should do?
Michael:	4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Michael:	Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Michael:	Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

849.
Pam:	Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Jim:	Great.
Meredith:	They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Andy:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

850.
Michael:	Yeah, they used to.
Dwight:	May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Dwight:	May I please speak to your boss?
Meredith:	Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Michael:	I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.
Sherri:	[on phone] Jan Levinson's office.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	No, I don't want to wear a bra.

851.
Dwight:	Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Stanley:	Chocolate.
Jan:	Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Hunter:	Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.

852.
Pam:	See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Nellie:	Oh, please don't use the hourglass.
Creed:	You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

853.
Dwight:	Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Toby:	Great point.
Dwight:	We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

854.
Creed:	That's not why.
School Official:	We teach our students that character counts.
Kevin:	Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jim:	Nice.

855.
Ben Franklin:	Well, actually, I never was president.
Katy:	Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Dwight:	It's a mini-briefcase.
Phyllis:	Do you have a black eye?
Ryan:	Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Ryan:	America is one big mall.
Dwight:	Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
Pam:	Not relevant.
Phyllis:	Why isn't Dwight turning around?
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

856.
Jim:	What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Angela:	Where's Dwight?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Ryan:	Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Prince:	Grandfather: So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?

857.
Phyllis:	20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Dwight:	I could have stopped him.
Holly:	Cool! You drive your own car?
Jim:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	No. Let's talk for a long time.

858.
Michael:	Thank you.
Michael:	[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?

859.
Pam:	I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Meredith:	Hey!
Dwight:	Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Andy:	Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Jim:	Wow.
Jim:	Nice try, this is ridiculous.
Jim:	What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Nellie Bertram:	First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
Dwight:	There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?

860.
Michael:	Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
Dwight:	Oh we know.
Michael:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Jim:	[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Pam:	Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Michael:	Smiles.
Michael:	It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]

861.
Ryan:	You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
speaker:	line_text
AJ:	I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
Toby:	He said that?
Angela:	You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Angela:	I hate beet salad.
Ryan:	That's all he wrote?
Angela:	I don't think that this is---
Toby:	Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.

862.
Michael:	That is the way Southern people talk.
Jim:	OK.
Everyone:	[shouting] Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!
Michael:	Yeah.
Ryan:	Yeah.
Jim:	Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?

863.
Michael:	Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Roy:	That's awesome. That's what I want.
David:	Yes.
Michael:	I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Michael:	You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
Michael:	Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.

864.
Michael:	I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Pam:	That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Jan:	So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
Michael:	You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Angela:	It's alright.
Pam:	No, don't.  I'm mad at them.
Michael:	Holdin' down the fort.
Michael:	And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?

865.
Michael:	Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Pete:	Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
Michael:	Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.
Michael:	He's going to absolutely freak.
Oscar:	Just- no.  No.
Gabe:	Let's go ahead and wash our hands.

866.
Michael:	[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
Michael:	Very valid.
Ryan:	Is your wife still your contact?
Andy:	I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Oscar:	Mmm...
Oscar:	Nothing.  I didn't say anything.

867.
Michael:	Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Ryan:	Oh, great.
Oscar:	I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Angela:	Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Angela:	Yes.

868.
Andy:	People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
Michael:	Uh, just a few more items.
Oscar:	With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Jim:	[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.

869.
Oscar:	What is that?
Dwight:	Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
Angela:	Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Girl:	Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
Man:	Are you sure about that?

870.
Ryan:	Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Well...
Jim:	And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Donna:	I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

871.
Michael:	Um, yup, wait, yes.
Pam:	Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Ben:	Hi Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Roy:	Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.

872.
Andy:	Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Roy:	[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
Dwight:	Thirty-two meatballs.
Michael:	AIDS.
Billy Merchant:	I don't know, like 30 seconds?
Michael:	It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.
Dwight:	Oh, hey, I���ll take a coffee.
Dwight:	Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.

873.
Dwight:	Got it.
Dwight:	Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Wolf:	Do you want this paper?
Michael:	Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
Jim:	It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Michael:	Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
Michael:	Ah, thank you sir.
Angela:	Dwight, we're fine!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim:	You alright, Santa?
Michael:	Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?

874.
Erin:	I would have chosen the 1490's.
Kevin:	Angela, this is inappropriate.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Toby:	Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
Darryl:	It is worth it.
Angela:	Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Michael:	Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
Michael:	...and you just walk negatively.
Erin:	Wow!

875.
Dwight:	Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Andy:	[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Dwight:	Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?

876.
Erin:	Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Stanley:	Do we have to play?
Erin:	Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
Jim:	Thanks.
Michael:	Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
Erin:	She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
Dwight:	Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Kevin:	Hi.
Dwight:	Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]

877.
Michael:	[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	I just need you to know-
Phyllis:	Good night, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Andy:	My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Michael:	You got it?

878.
David:	There is no plan.
Erin:	Goodbye for a very very long time.
Michael:	Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Darryl:	Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Roy:	Hey, man.
Erin:	I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Erin:	I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Michael:	Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Michael:	Oh... That's gonna change. [laughing]
Darryl:	Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?

879.
Creed:	I don't know, man. I just don't know.
Kenny:	All of it.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Phyllis:	It's really cute.
David:	[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
Phyllis:	How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?

880.
Michael:	All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Erin:	I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Erin:	Oh, who else is going?
Michael:	How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.

881.
Kevin:	It was like two hundred dollars.
Angela:	Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Let me get your stroller.
Michael:	Yeah that sounds good.

882.
Pam:	Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Dwight:	Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Kelly:	I just had the longest meeting.
Oscar:	Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?

883.
Pam:	Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
Darryl:	I can go get us some tacos.
Michael:	It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Michael:	Woo! Yeah!
Jessica:	Oh.
Michael:	Yeesh...
Michael:	I'll call her later.
Michael:	Is there another option?
Andy:	That really works.
Michael:	Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.

884.
Andy:	Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
Nellie:	You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
Andy:	Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
Dwight:	Please Michael, please.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Andy:	No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.

885.
Michael:	I know, I know.
Katy:	You should make a toast.
Michael:	Oh, you idiot.
Holly:	[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
Creed:	[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Are we ready for the game?
Michael:	Jan... Ryan.

886.
Ryan:	Now I have it.
Karen:	Good luck, Halpert.
Michael:	I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
Pam:	Hey!
Andy:	What���s the story?
Michael:	I took a lot from other poems.
Michael:	You and Jim are close, huh?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Yeah.
Andy:	You mean a moon bounce.
Pam:	Are you pushing me off the phone?

887.
Jim:	Okay.
Michael:	I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
Pam:	What's this?
Jim:	Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?

888.
Jo:	It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Pam:	No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
Michael:	I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.

889.
Dwight:	Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Wolf:	It���s not very good.
Jan:	Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Jim:	And you'll be saved.
Jim:	Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
Michael:	I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Jim:	Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Jim:	Hey. I was just about to call you.
Dwight:	What? Idiot.
Dwight:	Ok, let him know that I'm here.

890.
Dwight:	I was aware that you were speaking.
Dwight:	Die. You just... You said it.
Kevin:	[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Angela:	Are you drunk?
Secretary:	Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.
Dwight:	I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Meredith:	[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Angela:	I tried. We didn't have time.
Angela:	People are dressed inappropriately.
Dwight:	Tokyo?

891.
Jim:	He's fine. He's indestructible.
Erin:	Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
David:	Yeah!
Nurse:	Okay, great.
Michael:	Really?
Jim:	What's that cooler?
Jim:	Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Cece:	[crying]

892.
Dwight:	Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Creed:	No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Jim:	Hey.
Michael:	No! Better!
Jim:	Nice.
Stanley:	I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Michael:	Even as pie.
Dwight:	So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	OK.

893.
Clark:	Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
Andy:	Why did we pretend like we work here?
Phyllis:	Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Oscar:	That's really not our job.
Oscar:	Ow! Robert?!
Robert:	It's nice. I know.
Andy:	I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
Andy:	Okay.
Andy:	Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Girl:	Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]

894.
Dwight:	Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Radio:	... banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. It'd been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots.'
Fred:	Yeah.
Michael:	I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
Ryan:	[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.

895.
Erin:	Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Customer:	Hi.
Dwight:	Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Michael:	Really?
Stanley:	We sit close.
Michael:	Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...

896.
Andy:	Do you like apples?
Michael:	Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Andy:	Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Pam:	Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
Host:	I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.
Einsteins:	Whoo!
Pam:	Yeah-- it's exciting.
Michael:	I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
Michael:	I... this is Creed.
Creed:	Huh?

897.
Dwight:	That's bad.
Darryl:	No, no, no. Maybe just later.
Kevin:	Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
Steve:	Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Thank you.
Dwight:	Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Dwight:	Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Megan:	I learned that half these people's email password is 'password.'

898.
Pam:	The eyebrow.
Jo:	Oh good morning sweetheart.
Jim:	But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Andy:	I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Meredith:	Yeah, it makes me sick.
Pam:	How would we know that?
Jim:	Probably is.
Andy:	Ho hah!....oh, shoot.
Pam:	Ah, no, it passed.  It's good.

899.
Pam:	Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Michael:	I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Michael:	Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
Michael :	Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Erin:	Six months.
Jim:	So, not prison.
Michael:	Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
Angel:	Please and thank you go a long way.

900.
Pete:	Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pete:	Okay.
Jim:	Keys, keys...
Michael:	On purpose?
Pam:	No, Michael.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Holly:	No.  I can do it.
Michael:	[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...

901.
Dwight:	[shouts from another room] What did you do?
Jim:	Yep.
David:	Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Darryl:	Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Michael:	She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Michael:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Aaaaah!
Michael:	Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.

902.
Jim:	What?
Michael:	Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
Jim:	How are things?
Jim:	Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
Tom:	Hey, future baby sis!
Jim:	Yeah, okay.
Kevin:	I have very little patience for stupidity.
Dwight:	It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Dwight:	No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.

903.
Phyllis:	Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Stanley:	Well...
Dwight:	Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Night-night.
Andy:	Night.

904.
Ed:	Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?
Angela:	Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
Phil:	Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Pam:	Oh, call me later!
Andy:	Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Andy:	[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Angela:	No, I'm not.
Pam:	A little different. What time is it there?
Pam:	Um, that spells incest.

905.
Phyllis:	You sound worried.
Gabe:	Corporate says to me, ���Gabe, we need you in Scranton.��� Scranton says, ���Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.��� So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
Pam:	Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
Stanley:	No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
Guy:	You know you're right.
Pam:	Well, you were never really engaged.
Pam:	Like what?
Phyllis:	Okay.

906.
Toby:	He seems fine.
Michael:	How much? How many pounds is it?
Michael:	If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Pam:	Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Donna:	That's pathetic.

907.
Michael:	Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Dwight:	Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Jim:	Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
Michael:	Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Todd Packer:	Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
Robert:	Tell my wife you're lying.
Jim:	He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Dwight:	Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Michael:	Yup.
Michael:	Yeah, Drew.
Michael:	[gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves]

908.
Kelly:	I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
Jessica:	Oh, he's on a call.
Michael:	There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.
Alice:	I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
Mark:	Hey, you must be Dwight!
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	Uh huh.
Dwight:	Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
Michael:	I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.

909.
Jim:	Okay.
Kevin:	I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Holly:	Well we could put it in storage... in case.
Pam:	What about five years from now?
Michael:	On purpose?
Michael:	Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
Michael:	Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.
Pam:	Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	Set!

910.
Erin:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Michael:	Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Creed:	I am indeed. How'd you know that?
Kevin:	What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Wolf:	Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Kevin:	You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!

911.
Pam:	I used a variation of your move.
Dwight:	Because we're friends.
Jim:	Ok.
Jim:	Actually not.  It was really so-so.
Dwight:	That's a realistic time line.
Michael:	Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

912.
Jim:	19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Andy:	That's a lie.
Ryan:	No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

913.
Kelly:	Ice Cream.
Erin:	Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Jim:	What? Yeah, right. As if.
Michael:	Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
Girl:	Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

914.
Hannah:	Shh!
Phyllis:	All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
Jim:	I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Jim:	What?
Jim:	I think she's awake.
Jim:	Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Phyllis:	It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
Jim:	[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
Jim:	Is that what happened to you?

915.
Dwight:	Yeah, we���ll see about that.
Jim:	She...
Jim:	Welcome back.
Jan:	I...
Andy:	Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Jim:	Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Oscar:	Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Dwight:	It happens occasionally.
Jim:	So what is going on, girl in the computer?

916.
Hannah:	He.
Jan:	Excuse me?
Carol:	Oh, great.
Phyllis:	Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jan:	[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Phyllis:	I know, Kevin.
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.

917.
Dwight:	What?
Boat Guy:	Nope. Can't do that.
Pam:	Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Michael:	Oh, ok. Alright.
Michael:	I just saw this baby daddy-
Oscar:	El telefono.
Michael:	Hey, you don't deserve her.

918.
Oscar:	Ow! You hit people with that thing?
Alice:	History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
Oscar:	[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Kevin:	No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Darryl:	Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.

919.
Mr. Schofield:	Michael, good to see you.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
Meredith:	[shocked expression]
Nellie:	Three...
Michael:	What are you doing?
Michael:	Ah, so when did you set up shop?
Michael:	And you guys are okay with this?
Michael:	No antigravity machine, huh?
Michael:	Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Michael:	Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.

920.
Michael:	Please just check.
Stephanie:	Please hold.
Pam:	About ten?
Pam:	Yeah!
Dwight:	[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
Erin:	I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Michael:	No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
Ryan:	Hey.
Michael:	Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.

921.
Meredith:	Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	What?

922.
Stanley:	Good day.
Michael:	Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Andy:	You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.

923.
Darryl:	I've seen this, that's not you.
Darryl:	Nine first.
Jim:	Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Pam:	Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
Jim:	Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Kevin:	Ohh.
Molly:	Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant.  And I guess it did get a little confusing  ���cause you said not to tell anyone your name.  And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...
Tom:	Hey, future baby sis!

924.
Trevor:	That���s very effective. I���ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It���s devastating.
Rolph:	It's true!
Jim:	Good!  What's goin' on here?
Pam:	But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Kelly:	Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Jim:	Damn.
Pam:	Let's just- let's go.
Jim:	So now you're writing two things?
Pam:	Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
Nellie:	Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.

925.
Pam:	Trip Advsior.
Deangelo:	Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
Andy:	[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
Kevin:	No!
Jim:	Please?

926.
Pam:	No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	What do you think of Kelly?
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Michael:	And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.

927.
Kevin:	Nice.
Karen:	[looks annoyed]
Clark:	There you go, good for you.
Ryan:	Hey.
Stanley:	So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Ryan:	Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Ryan:	Why no kids?
Kevin:	A wheel is supposed to spin.
Stanley:	I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Clark:	OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

928.
Jim:	Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Kevin:	Yes!
Phyllis:	[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Jim:	Dave.
Jan:	I'm your boss.

929.
Dwight:	Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Man:	Are you sure about that?
Creed:	This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Kevin:	Cool. Bye.
Jim:	I think you seem distracted.
Dwight:	It could be kind of funny.

930.
Mema:	What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Ex-client:	Oh, OK.
Pam:	Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
Clark:	There you go, good for you.
Angela:	[gasps]
Angela:	Oh. Thanks.
Angela:	[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

931.
Jim:	Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Michael:	I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
Michael:	[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Jim:	Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Michael:	Oh, that is gross.
Phyllis:	I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.

932.
Karen:	That is not healthy behavior.
Oscar:	That's as simple as I can make it.
Jan:	You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Pam:	Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Dwight:	No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Dwight:	Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

933.
Jim:	Alright. [Kelly squeals]
Kelly:	I have a customer meeting.
Esther:	We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Jim:	Mm, can't do that.
Michael:	Why?
Michael:	No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
Michael:	That's still going on?
Jim:	It���s great.
Jim:	Alright, there you go.

934.
Kevin:	Stay.
Darryl:	Mike.
Stanley:	We get that every year.
Andy:	Yeah, I know. Neiche!
Michael:	No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Michael:	Alright, have fun.
Michael:	I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Stanley:	Well...

935.
Erin:	Gabe!
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
Holly:	Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
Michael:	Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.

936.
Oscar:	Have you been to the beach yet?
Charles:	Okay, great.
Michael:	What!?
Robert:	No.

937.
Pastor:	Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the 'Halberts' have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
Michael:	Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
Erin:	Cool. Thanks.
Jim:	Oh. Right, that style.
Michael:	Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
Dwight:	I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Michael:	Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Michael:	Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Jim:	Oh.
Michael:	Uh huh.
Jim:	I'll take it.

938.
Businessman #1:	So the workspace looks awesome.
Ryan:	Unreal.
Meredith:	No thanks. They're too sweet.
Dwight:	What is this?
Calvin:	I wouldn't.
Dwight:	There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Dwight:	I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Clark:	Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.

939.
Roy:	Thanks...aw.
Michael:	Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
Angela:	What?
Dealer:	Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
Darryl:	You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Michael:	Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Guy:	I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Darryl:	[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
Michael:	[exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.
Darryl:	Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]

940.
Jim:	Okay. Sounds good.
Pam:	That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Darryl:	Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Michael:	Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Stanley:	Well...
Michael:	Ok.

941.
Dwight:	Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Michael:	Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.

942.
Deangelo:	I'm no MJ.  I can do his dunk.  From the free throw line.
Angela:	No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Robert:	I just did.
Michael:	Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.

943.
Dwight:	I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Dwight:	F. Alright, what's the damage?
Creed:	[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
Oscar:	You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.

944.
Jim:	Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	Riiight. The gym. [snickers]
Michael:	What a douche bag!
Pam:	Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?

945.
Michael:	This is the last
Danny:	But from where?
Michael:	Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Dan:	And that about does it, thank you.
Andy:	But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
Michael:	[long pause] Yes.
Michael:	You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.

946.
Michael:	Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael:	This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
Jim:	That's what she said.
Pam:	Hmm?
Angela:	Good.
Michael:	That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Angela:	No! God, Mose! God!
Mose:	But you promised.
Michael:	Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.
Packer:	Whoa. Hey.

947.
Todd Packer:	That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
Creed:	What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
Stanley:	I am not changing the way I do my files.
Oscar:	Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Jim:	Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Michael:	We're not.

948.
Ryan Howard:	Keep reading then.
David Wallace:	Well, thanks Dwight.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

949.
Andy:	Yeah.
Dwight:	What are you looking at?
Oscar:	No. [shakes head back and forth]
Angela:	Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
Harry:	Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse ���
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Jan:	Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Andy:	Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Andy:	Are they from you?

950.
Angela:	So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Pete:	Fax?
Robert Dunder:	And...
Phyllis:	Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'

951.
Nellie:	Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Jim:	Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Jan:	...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
Michael:	[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Michael:	Why?
Michael:	Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Jim:	Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	You probably won't.

952.
Michael:	Okay.
Angela:	[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Old lady:	Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
Michael:	I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
Jim:	[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

953.
Michael:	Okay.
Michael:	Why?  Wha...
Jim:	Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

954.
Ryan:	Can you get me a cold water?
Gabe:	Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
Michael:	Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Dwight:	DRAW SOME BLOOD!
Dwight:	Try influenza.
Dwight:	[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Michael:	I don't know. I think so.

955.
Lonny:	Yeah?  I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?
Pam:	That's OK.
Dwight:	AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Ernesto:	Hola Toby! [mimes choking]
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Toby:	Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Dwight:	It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Dwight:	I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	Swaying isn't dancing.
Dwight:	Huh? You like that?

956.
Andy:	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
Michael:	So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's? [to camera]  Go to Bernie's?
Pam:	Personal shopper?
Michael:	Agreed?
Jim:	Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

957.
Angela:	[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Stanley:	Well...
Phyllis:	Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Bob:	Yes!
Pam:	No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
Pam:	[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Nate:	Hola amigo.
Angela:	Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Pam:	Jim!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

958.
Gabe:	Honestly, it was a little weird.
Meredith:	Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Holly:	Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Chet:	I want to be on TV!
TV:	And the winner is, by two votes- [TV goes blank]
Holly:	Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Gabe:	Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Gabe:	[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
Holly:	Let me see.

959.
Michael:	Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Pam:	I think he meant personal day.
Jim:	Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Erin:	Oh.
Karen:	Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Michael:	[Knock at the door] Yeah.
Michael:	That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
Michael:	Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
Dwight.:	Hello, Pam.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]

960.
Ryan:	And if I flake, I flake.
Pam:	He's more, just... like... you can go.
Robert:	This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.
Dwight:	Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
Jim:	It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
Wade:	Okay
Jim:	Oh, nothing.
Jim:	Okay.
Pam:	That's Stanley Hudson.
Stanley:	Well...
Jim:	Ok...
Pam:	Yeah.

961.
Dwight:	Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Phyllis:	So what does downsizing actually mean?
Phyllis:	Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Bob:	Yes!

962.
Michael:	Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Luke:	Coffee Monkey's arrived.
Creed:	He has no wallet, I checked.
Jim:	Hey, how is... Toby?
Toby:	Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Michael:	Oh, big time.
Jim:	But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Michael:	Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.

963.
Jim:	Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Karen:	Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Kevin:	[giggling]
Andy:	It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
VRG 1:	Down the hall.
Andy:	You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
Jim:	Andy, come on.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.

964.
Pam:	I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
Andy:	Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
Darry:	It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Cathy:	Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Pam:	And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
Andy:	Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

965.
Jim:	Really?
Erin:	Yeah.
All:	Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.
Stanley:	I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Michael:	Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Jim:	MmmHmm...
Jim:	You know, try sending them another invoice.
Michael:	Kev...  Nice.  Going.
Jim:	I'm not.
Jim:	Yeah.

966.
Pam:	[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
Dwight:	Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
Kevin:	I think you do, mon.
Michael:	We're not.
Pam:	Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
Jim:	I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Jim :	[fingers opened an inch] This close.
Jim:	You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Pam:	Uh, sure.
Dwight:	What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Jim:	What kinda iPhone is that?
Phone:	Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.

967.
Dwight:	I'm talking about... hmmm.
Pam:	I don't think anyone thought that.
Erin:	Wow, it smells really good too.
Andy:	Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Erin:	If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.

968.
Ryan:	[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Pam:	Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
Charles:	Michael, you're back.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

969.
Mr. Ramish:	What���s going on?
Meredith:	Thank you!
Pam:	Mm-hmm.
Michael:	I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Stanley:	Well...
Pam:	Who? The -

970.
Karen:	What!
Dwight:	Yeah!
Jim:	[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
Pam:	[vaudeville delivery] Yee.
Dwight:	What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Michael:	No, he's not.
Dwight:	Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?

971.
Dwight:	Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

972.
Jim:	Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Toby:	[laughs out loud] Excuse me.
Stanley:	They are not.
Erin:	Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.
Pam:	Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
Jim:	we good?

973.
David:	I do.
Stanley:	Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
Jim:	Nice job.
Jim:	If you could help me out, that would be���
Dwight:	And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Dwight:	But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Dwight:	Kathy.
Kathy:	Hi.

974.
Nellie:	Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Ryan:	I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
Michael:	Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say 'stuff a cold'?  Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.
Michael:	Yeah.
Kelly:	I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ryan:	You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Jim:	We are doing worst first dates.

975.
Dwight:	Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Pam:	You look real thin.
Karen:	Nice basket.
Andy:	Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
Pam:	Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Pam:	What are we doing?
Michael:	I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...
Dwight:	Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Others:	Yeah.
Dwight:	Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!

976.
Jim:	Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Kevin:	Yeah, it'll be you.
Jim:	Good.
Michael:	Pam?
Pam:	Well. I don't know.

977.
Oscar:	No, they just made out.  That's it.
Pam:	Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones.
Andy:	And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Jim:	Flooded.
Michael:	Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Michael:	Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Michael:	Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Michael:	Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Michael:	Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.

978.
Deangelo:	[holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight]
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim:	I was gonna go with this one.
Michael:	All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
Jan:	[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Dwight:	We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

979.
Michael:	I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
DeAngelo:	Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
Michael:	Tonight's so...
Dwight:	It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Jim:	Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Ryan:	Baby, Baby, Baby--

980.
Angela:	Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Dwight:	You are the master.
Pam:	[speakerphone] Hi everyone!

981.
Michael:	Hi.
Pam:	Wow, you did neighborhood watch?
Dwight:	She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	No, my groin...
Customer:	Hear what?
Dwight:	Really?
Dwight:	The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
Pam:	Ta-da!

982.
Michael:	Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
David:	David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Jo:	Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
abe:	Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Creed:	Huh?
Michael:	You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
David:	How was the ride?
Michael:	Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.

983.
Michael:	They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
Dwight :	When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Jim:	Seriously?
Michael:	Well...
Jim:	Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
Dwight:	Ha! I don't get it.
Pam:	[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

984.
Michael:	Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
Sam:	Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Michael:	No, no, really not necessary.
Ryan:	All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!

985.
Dwight:	What?
Oscar:	I can't.
Kevin:	Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Michael:	This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.

986.
Erin:	Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	Tell me about it.
Pam:	[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Michael:	I know where this is goin'.
Andy:	[at dump] It's freezing out here.
Jim:	But you didn't fail.
Jim:	Nice. Third book?
Erin:	Hi.
Michael:	Yeah.
Pam:	There's no yelling in that, either.

987.
Andy:	17 B.C.
Michael:	Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
Michael:	Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Jim:	[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?

988.
Michael:	No, please, please...
Erin:	No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Jim:	No, I'm not gonna do that.
Jan:	What?
Michael:	No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Pam:	Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Michael:	Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
Dwight:	[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

989.
Jim:	Where do I want to go?
Everybody:	[singing] ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you...
Meredith:	Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Meredith:	Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Michael:	No it's okay, we're talking code.
Dwight:	[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
Michael:	But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
Jim:	You know what? I could use a little help.
Jim:	Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Everybody:	Surprise!

990.
Meredith:	Don't patronize me.
Dwight:	Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Gabe:	Yes, it is.
Jim:	Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Andy:	Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
Dwight:	Got it.
Jim:	[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...

991.
Jim:	Okay.
Michael:	No.
Michael:	On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
Kevin:	Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Jim:	What does that mean?

992.
Dwight:	Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
Michael:	We're not hiring, Jim.
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael:	I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Michael:	All right. This is gonna be good.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Michael:	All right.
All:	Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Dwight:	Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.

993.
Michael:	Yes, Andy.
Andy:	Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?
Phyllis:	Michael, that's awful.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Group:	Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!

994.
Jim:	How are things?
Pam:	Everything okay?
Michael:	Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Angela:	[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
Andy:	Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
Michael:	[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
Katy:	This one is hand embroidered.
Jim:	Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Pam:	Well. I don't know.
Pam:	Hey guys, what's going on?
Michael:	A what?
Andy:	Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.

995.
Roy:	Engaged, yeah.
Nellie:	Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Michael:	You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
Luke:	Coffee Monkey's arrived.
Michael:	You got it?
Dwight:	Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Michael:	Hey, hey, hey
Dwight:	Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.

996.
Dwight:	Quiet you.
Michael:	Okay.
Dwight:	You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Dwight:	La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Jim:	He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Steve:	Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael:	All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim:	Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Dwight:	Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
Angela:	I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

997.
Kevin:	We did it.
Jim:	We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Holly:	Yep. Just like you.
Dwight:	Hello? Hello?
Michael:	Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.

998.
Gabe:	Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
song:	['Everybody Hurts' by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.
